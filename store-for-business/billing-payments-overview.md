# Billing and payments

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The retirement of Microsoft Store for Business and Microsoft Store for Education has been postponed. We will update this notice when a new retirement date is announced. You can continue to use the current capabilities of free apps until that time. For more information about this change, see [Update to Intune integration with the Microsoft Store on Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/update-to-endpoint-manager-integration-with-the-microsoft-store/ba-p/3585077) and [FAQ: Supporting Microsoft Store experiences on managed devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-management/faq-supporting-microsoft-store-experiences-on-managed-devices/m-p/3585286).
> - In April 2023 the Microsoft Store for Business tab was removed from Microsoft Store apps on Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs. The Microsoft Store for Business tab will continue to be available on Hololens devices. Users will no longer be able to see products added to the private store within the Microsoft Store app and will need to go to the [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com/) website to access the private store. The [ApplicationManagement/RequirePrivateStoreOnly](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-configuration-service-provider#ApplicationManagement_RequirePrivateStoreOnly) MDM policy and **Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store app** Group policy will block access to the Microsoft Store app entirely.
