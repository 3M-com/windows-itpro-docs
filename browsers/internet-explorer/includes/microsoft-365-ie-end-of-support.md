> [!IMPORTANT]
The Internet Explorer 11 desktop application is [retired and out of support](https://aka.ms/IEJune15Blog) as of June 15, 2022 for certain versions of Windows 10.  

You can still access older, legacy sites that require Internet Explorer with Internet Explorer mode in Microsoft Edge. [Learn how](https://aka.ms/IEmodewebsite). 

The Internet Explorer 11 desktop application will progressively redirect to the faster, more secure Microsoft Edge browser, and will ultimately be disabled via Windows Update. [Disable IE today](/deployedge/edge-ie-disable-ie11).
