# Manual OOBE

If you are setting up a Windows 11 SE device individually and network bandwidth is not an issue, you can use the out-of-the-box, first-run setup experience to configure the device, join it to your school’s Azure Active Directory account, and enroll it in Intune.

### Configure, join, and enroll devices

When using OOBE, no advance preparation is needed:

1. Follow the on-screen prompts for region selection, keyboard selection, and network connection. 
1. Wait for updates. If any updates are available, they will be installed at this time.

3. When prompted, select **Work or School Account**. This will deploy Windows 11 SE to the device within a few minutes.
