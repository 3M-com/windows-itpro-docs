# Why read this cookbook?

Microsoft 365 solutions for Education empower education professionals to unlock creativity, promote teamwork, and provide a simple and safe experience for everyone—all in a comprehensive and affordable cloud offering. This cookbook introduces the tools and services available from Microsoft for deploying and managing devices in schools, thereby enabling modern device management across the school environment. The cookbook is intended for education professionals responsible for these efforts, including:  
- System or school leaders
- IT administrators
- Teachers
- Microsoft partners

In the cookbook, we provide a comprehensive path for schools to enroll, deploy, and manage new Surface Laptop SE and Windows 11 SE devices. Specifically, we include step-by-step guidance on the deployment, management, and resetting of the new Surface Laptop SE and Windows 11 SE operating system for education. At multiple steps, we also highlight resources available on Microsoft Docs to help with your rollout. Note that depending on your school setup scenario, you may not need to implement all steps.

# New expectations for education technology

Microsoft recognizes that the education landscape continues to change rapidly and dramatically. To better equip students for success, it’s essential for schools to stay up to date with technology and tools for teaching and learning. The Microsoft cloud management solution is flexible, affordable, and scalable—helping to ensure that devices are easily updated and students always have what they need, whether they're learning in person or remotely, synchronously or asynchronously. Microsoft also delivers exceptional standards of security and privacy to keep students safer as the hybrid learning model evolves. 

Below are some additional key ways that Microsoft addresses expectations for modern device management in school environments:

- **Maximize learning time.** Schools expect lower boot times for an enhanced user experience for students and staff, all on a device optimized for the classroom. They also expect devices to always be up to date with policies that update silently and outside of class time. Intune for Education enables automatic updates to all school devices and software at optimal times you choose. 
- **Designed for learning environments.** Schools need identity-based management for secure app delivery and simple device management. They also need to ensure that the right apps are delivered at the right time. With Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Intune for Education, you can enable profile-based app delivery with the ability to manage device policies, settings, and apps. You can also save time setting up devices with more apps and policies preinstalled and pre-configured than ever before—simply enroll and go.
- **Simplify deployment and management.** End-to-end guidance and support from Microsoft and partners can help schools streamline both deployment and cloud migration. With Intune for Education and Surface SE devices, education professionals can deploy apps to users and apply device settings that create a great classroom experience in just a few simple steps.
- **Cost-effective remote management.** Intune for Education enables a modern IT environment—complete with remote management—in school settings. This helps to provide reduced and more predictable IT costs, along with better performance, availability, and security. Intune for Education also enables a predictable and stable software as a service (SaaS) model, which eliminates spending spikes from upgrading hardware and software.
