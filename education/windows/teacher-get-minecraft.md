# For teachers - get Minecraft: Education Edition

The following article describes how teachers can get and distribute Minecraft: Education Edition at their school. Minecraft: Education Edition is available for anyone to trial, and subscriptions can be purchased by qualified educational institutions directly in the [Microsoft Admin Center by IT Admins](https://docs.microsoft.com/education/windows/school-get-minecraft), via volume licensing agreements and through partner resellers. 


## Try Minecraft: Education Edition for Free 

Minecraft: Education Edition is available for anyone to try for free! The free trial is fully functional but limited by the number of logins (25 for teachers and 10 for students) before a paid license will be required to continue playing.

To learn more and get started, [download the Minecraft: Education Edition app here.](https://aka.ms/download)

## Purchase Minecraft: Education Edition for Teachers and Students

As a teacher, you will need to have your IT Admin purchase licenses for you and your students directly through the Microsoft Admin Center, or you may already have access to licenses at your school (through a volume license agreement) if you have an Office 365 subscription. 

M:EE is included in many volume license agreements, however, only the administrators at your school will be able to assign and manage those licenses. If you have an Office 365 account, check with your school administration or IT administrator prior to purchasing M:EE directly. 


#### Troubleshoot
