## Remote device management

With Intune for Education, you can manage groups, applications, resources, and individual needs of multiple students. There are several ways to manage students' devices, including organizing what groups they belong to; determining what apps they have access to; and configuring device settings, customizations, and restrictions. You can also monitor when users sign in and troubleshoot devices remotely.

## Remote assistance

With devices managed by Intune for Education, you can remotely assist students and teachers with device issues. For more information, see [Remote assistance for managed devices - Intune for Education](/intune-education/remote-assist-mobile-devices).
