# New expectations for education technology

Microsoft 365 solutions for Education empower education professionals to unlock creativity, promote teamwork, and provide a safe experience for everyone—all in a comprehensive and affordable cloud offering.

Microsoft recognizes that the education landscape continues to change rapidly. To better enable students for success, it's essential for schools to stay up to date with technology and tools for teaching and learning.
The Microsoft cloud management solution is flexible, affordable and scalable. Devices can be easily kept up to date, and students always have what they need, whether they're learning in person or remotely, synchronously or asynchronously.
Microsoft also delivers exceptional standards of security and privacy to keep students safer as the hybrid learning model evolves.

Microsoft addresses expectations for modern device management in school environments in four key ways:

- **Maximize learning time.** Schools expect lower boot times for an enhanced user experience for students and staff, all on a device optimized for the classroom. They also expect devices to always be up to date with policies that update silently and outside of class time. Intune for Education enables automatic updates to all school devices and software at optimal times you choose.
- **Designed for learning environments.** Schools need identity-based management for secure app delivery and simple device management. They also need to ensure that the right apps are delivered at the right time. With Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Intune for Education, you can enable profile-based app delivery with the ability to manage device policies, settings, and applications. You can save time by pre-installing applications and configuring policies to control the device's behaviors, just enroll the devices in Intune and go!
- **Simplify deployment and management.** End-to-end guidance and support from Microsoft and partners can help schools streamline both deployment and cloud migration. With Intune for Education and Surface SE devices, education professionals can deploy apps to users and apply device settings that create a great classroom experience in just a few simple steps.
- **Cost-effective remote management.** Intune for Education enables a modern IT environment, complete with remote management, with pre-defined school settings. This helps to provide reduced and more predictable IT costs, along with better performance, availability, and security. Intune for Education also enables a predictable and stable *Software as a Service* (SaaS) model, which eliminates spending spikes from upgrading hardware and software.
