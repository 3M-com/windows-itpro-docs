# Configure Stickers for Windows 11 SE

Starting in **Windows 11 SE, version 22H2**, *Stickers* is a new feature that allows students to decorate their desktop with digital stickers. Students can choose from over 500 cheerful, education-friendly digital stickers. Stickers can be arranged, resized, and customized on top of the desktop background. Each student's stickers remain, even when the background change.

Similar to the [education theme packs](edu-themes.md), Stickers is a personalization feature that helps the device feel like it was designed for students.

Stickers are simple to use, and give students an easy way to express themselves by decorating their desktop, helping to make learning fun.

## Benefits of Stickers

When students feel like they can express themselves at school, they pay more attention and learn, which benefits students, teachers, and the school community. Self-expression is critical to well-being and success at school. Customizing a device is one way to express a personal brand.

With Stickers, students feel more attached to the device as they feel as if it's their own, they take better care of it, and it's more likely to last.
