          IT Admins can manage system settings (including application installation and the application store) to ensure all students have a safe, distraction-free experience. On Windows SE devices, you have pre-installed apps from Microsoft, from your IT admin, and from your device manufacturer. You can continue to use web apps on the Microsoft Edge browser, as web apps do not require installation.
          For more information, see [Configure applications with Microsoft Intune](education/windows/tutorial-school-deployment/configure-device-app).
