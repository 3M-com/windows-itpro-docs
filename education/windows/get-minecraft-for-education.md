## Try or purchase Minecraft Education

Users in a Microsoft-verified academic institution account have access to a free trial for Minecraft Education. This grants faculty accounts 25 free logins, and student accounts 10 free logins before a paid license will be required to continue playing.

Subscriptions can be purchased by qualified educational institutions directly in the [*Microsoft 365 admin center*](https://admin.microsoft.com), via volume licensing agreements, or through partner resellers.

When you sign up for a Minecraft Education trial, or purchase a subscription, Minecraft Education licenses are associated to your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.  If you don't have an Azure AD tenant, you can set up a free Office 365 Education subscription when you purchase Minecraft Education. For more information, see [Office 365 Education plans and pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/academic/compare-office-365-education-plans).

### Direct purchase

To purchase direct licenses:

1. Go to [https://education.minecraft.net/](https://education.minecraft.net/) and select **How to Buy** in the top navigation bar
1. Scroll down and select **Buy Now** under **Direct Purchase**

If you need more licenses for Minecraft Education, see [Buy or remove subscription licenses](/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/buy-licenses).

### Volume licensing

Qualified education institutions can purchase Minecraft Education licenses through their Microsoft channel partner. Schools need to be part of the *Enrollment for Education Solutions* (EES) volume licensing program. Educational institutions should work with their channel partner to determine which Minecraft Education licensing offer is best for their institution. The process looks like this:

1. Your channel partner will submit and process your volume license order
1. Your licenses will be shown on [Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx)
1. You'll need to [Assign Minecraft Education licenses](#assign-minecraft-education-licenses) to your users

### Payment options

You can pay for Minecraft Education with a debit or credit card, or with an invoice.

#### Debit or credit cards

During the purchase, select **Add a new payment method**. Provide the information needed for your debit or credit card.

#### Invoices

Invoices are a supported payment method for Minecraft Education. There are a few requirements:

- $500 invoice minimum for your initial purchase
- $15,000 invoice maximum (for all invoices within your organization)

To pay with an invoice:

1. During the purchase, select **Add a new payment method.**
2. Select the **Invoice** option, and provide the information needed for an invoice. The **PO number** item allows you to add a tracking number or info that is meaningful to your organization.

For more information about invoices and how to pay by invoice, see [Payment options for your Microsoft subscription](/microsoft-365/commerce/billing-and-payments/pay-for-your-subscription).  

## Assign Minecraft Education licenses

You can assign and manage Minecraft Education licenses from the Microsoft 365 admin center.\
The Microsoft 365 admin center can be accessed by members of your organization with administrative roles.
