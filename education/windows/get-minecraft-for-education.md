## Try or purchase Minecraft Education

<!--To get started, [download the Minecraft Education here.](https://aka.ms/download)-->

Users in a Microsoft-verified academic institution account have access to a free trial limited logins for Minecraft Education. This grants faculty accounts 25 free logins, and student accounts 10 free logins before a paid license will be required to continue playing.

Subscriptions can be purchased by qualified educational institutions directly in the [Microsoft Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com), via volume licensing agreements, or through partner resellers.\

### Direct purchase

To purchase direct licenses:

1. Go to [https://education.minecraft.net/](https://education.minecraft.net/) and select **How to Buy** in the top navigation bar
1. Scroll down and select **Buy Now** under **Direct Purchase**
1. This will route you to the purchase page in the Microsoft Admin center. You will need to log in to your Administrator account
1. If necessary, fill in any requested organization or payment information
1. Select the quantity of licenses you would like to purchase and select **Place Order**
1. After you've purchased licenses, you'll need to [assign them to users in the Admin Center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users)

If you need additional licenses for Minecraft Education, see [Buy or remove subscription licenses](/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/buy-licenses).

### Volume licensing

Qualified education institutions can purchase Minecraft Education licenses through their Microsoft channel partner. Schools need to be part of the *Enrollment for Education Solutions* (EES) volume licensing program. Educational institutions should work with their channel partner to determine which Minecraft Education licensing offer is best for their institution. The process looks like this:

- Your channel partner will submit and process your volume license order, your licenses will be shown on [Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx), and the licenses will be available in your [Microsoft Store for Education](https://www.microsoft.com/business-store) inventory
- You'll receive an email with a link to Microsoft Store for Education
- Sign in to [Microsoft Store for Education](https://educationstore.microsoft.com) to distribute and manage the Minecraft Education licenses. For more information on distribution options, see [Distribute Minecraft](#distribute-minecraft)

### Payment options

You can pay for Minecraft Education with a debit or credit card, or with an invoice.

#### Debit or credit cards

During the purchase, select **Add a new payment method**. Provide the information needed for your debit or credit card.

#### Invoices

Invoices are a supported payment method for Minecraft Education. There are a few requirements:

- $500 invoice minimum for your initial purchase
- $15,000 invoice maximum (for all invoices within your organization)

To pay with an invoice:

1. During the purchase, select **Add a new payment method.**
2. Select the **Invoice** option, and provide the information needed for an invoice. The **PO number** item allows you to add a tracking number or info that is meaningful to your organization.

For more information about invoices and how to pay by invoice, see [How to pay for your subscription](/microsoft-365/commerce/billing-and-payments/pay-for-your-subscription?).  

## Assign Minecraft Education licenses

When you sign up for a Minecraft Education trial, or purchase a subscription, Minecraft Education licenses are associated to your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. From the Admin Center, you can assign and manage Minecraft Education licenses.\
The Microsoft Admin Center can be accessed by members of your organization with administrative roles. For more information, see [About Intune Admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/business-premium/m365bp-intune-admin-roles-in-the-mac)

>[!Note]
>If you don't have an Azure AD tenant, you can set up a free Office 365 Education subscription when you purchase Minecraft Education. For more information, see [Office 365 Education plans and pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/academic/compare-office-365-education-plans).

## Prerequisites

- For a complete list of Operating Systems supported by Minecraft Education, see [here](https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/articles/360047556591-System-Requirements).

## Settings for Microsoft 365 A3 or Microsoft 365 A5 customers

Schools that purchased Microsoft 365 A3 or Microsoft 365 A5 have an extra option for making Minecraft Education available to their students:

If your school has these products in your tenant, admins can choose to enable Minecraft Education for students using Microsoft 365 A3 or Microsoft 365 A5. From the left-hand menu in Microsoft Admin Center, select Users. From the Users list, select the users you want to add or remove for Minecraft Education access. Add the relevant A3 or A5 license if it hasn't been assigned already.

> [!Note]
> If you add a faculty license, the user will be assigned an instructor role in the application and will have elevated permissions.

After selecting the appropriate product license, ensure Minecraft Education is toggled on or off, depending on if you want to add or remove Minecraft Education from the user (it will be on by default).

If you turn off this setting after students have been using Minecraft Education, they will have up to 30 more days to use Minecraft Education before they don't have access.

## Distribute Minecraft

After Minecraft Education is added to your Microsoft Admin Center inventory, you can [assign these licenses to your users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users) or [download the app](https://aka.ms/downloadmee).

If you're having trouble installing the app, you can get more help on our [Support page](https://aka.ms/minecraftedusupport).
