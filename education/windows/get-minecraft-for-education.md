## Try or purchase Minecraft Education

Minecraft Education is available for anyone to trial, and subscriptions can be purchased by qualified educational institutions directly in the [Microsoft Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com), via volume licensing agreements or through partner resellers.\
The free trial is fully functional but limited by the number of logins (25 for teachers and 10 for students) before a paid license will be required to continue playing.

To get started, [download the Minecraft Education here.](https://aka.ms/download)

### Assign Minecraft Education licenses

When you sign up for a Minecraft Education trial, or purchase a subscription, Minecraft Education licenses are associated to your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. From the Admin Center, you can assign and manage Minecraft Education licenses.\
The Microsoft Admin Center can be accessed by members of your organization with administrative roles.

>[!Note]
>If you don't have an Azure AD tenant, you can set up a free Office 365 Education subscription when you purchase Minecraft Education. For more information, see [Office 365 Education plans and pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/academic/compare-office-365-education-plans).

## Prerequisites

- For a complete list of Operating Systems supported by Minecraft Education, see [here](https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/articles/360047556591-System-Requirements).

## Settings for Microsoft 365 A3 or Microsoft 365 A5 customers

Schools that purchased Microsoft 365 A3 or Microsoft 365 A5 have an extra option for making Minecraft Education available to their students:

If your school has these products in your tenant, admins can choose to enable Minecraft Education for students using Microsoft 365 A3 or Microsoft 365 A5. From the left-hand menu in Microsoft Admin Center, select Users. From the Users list, select the users you want to add or remove for Minecraft Education access. Add the relevant A3 or A5 license if it hasn't been assigned already. 

> [!Note]
> If you add a faculty license, the user will be assigned an instructor role in the application and will have elevated permissions.

After selecting the appropriate product license, ensure Minecraft Education is toggled on or off, depending on if you want to add or remove Minecraft Education from the user (it will be on by default).

If you turn off this setting after students have been using Minecraft Education, they will have up to 30 more days to use Minecraft Education before they don't have access.
