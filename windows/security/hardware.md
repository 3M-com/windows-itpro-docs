# Windows hardware security

Modern threats require modern security with a strong alignment between hardware security and software security techniques to keep users, data and devices protected. The operating system alone cannot protect from the wide range of tools and techniques cybercriminals use to compromise a computer deep inside its silicon. Once inside, intruders can be difficult to detect while engaging in multiple nefarious activities from stealing important data to capturing email addresses and other sensitive pieces of information.
These new threats call for computing hardware that is secure down to the very core, including hardware chips and processors. Microsoft and our partners, including chip and device manufacturers, have worked together to integrate powerful security capabilities across software, firmware, and hardware. 
With Windows 11, we have raised the hardware security baseline to design the most secure version of Windows ever. We have carefully chosen the hardware requirements and default security features based on threat intelligence and input from leading experts around the globe, including our own Microsoft Cybersecurity team.  
Though a powerful combination of hardware root-of-trust and silicon-assisted security, Windows 11 delivers built-in hardware protection out-of-the box.
