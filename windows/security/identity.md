# Windows identity security
 
Malicious actors launch an average of 50 million password attacks every dayâ€”579 per second. And Identity is the battleground for attacks of the future. Knowing that the right user is accessing the right device and the right data is critical to keeping your business, family, and self, safe and secure. Windows 11 correctly identifies users while delivering a high-quality user experience, which helps hybrid and remote workers stay productive without sacrificing security.

New Windows 11 devices protect users by removing vulnerable passwords by default, from day one. Weak passwords, password spraying, and phishing are the entry point for many attacks. Windows Hello, Windows Hello for Business, and Credential Guard enable customers to move to passwordless multifactor authentication (MFA). MFA can reduce the risk of compromise in organizations by more than 99.9 percent. As remote and hybrid work becomes the new normal, Windows 11 gives IT teams a variety of MFA options to meet business and consumer needs while complying with ever-evolving regulations.
