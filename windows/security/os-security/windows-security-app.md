Visibility and awareness of device security and health is key to any action taken. The Windows built-in security app provides an at-a-glance view of the security status and health of your device. These insights help you identify issues and take action to make sure youâ€™re protected. You can quickly see the status of your virus and threat protection, firewall and network security, device security controls, and more. 

The Windows Security app in Windows 11 looks a lot like what you see in Windows 10, with the addition of the new **Protection history** button and increased security features and capabilities.

The following table describes the various sections of the Windows Security app.<br/><br/>
