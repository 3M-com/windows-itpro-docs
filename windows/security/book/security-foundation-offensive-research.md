## Secure Future Initiative (SFI)

Launched in November 2023, the Microsoft Secure Future Initiative (SFI) is a multiyear commitment dedicated to advancing the way we design, build, test, and operate our technology. Our goal is to ensure that our solutions meet the highest possible standards for security.

The increasing scale and high stakes of cyberattacks prompted the launch of SFI. This program brings together every part of Microsoft to enhance cybersecurity protection across our company and products. We carefully considered our internal observations and feedback from customers, governments, and partners to identify the greatest opportunities to impact the future of security.

To maintain accountability and keep our customers, partners, and the security community informed, Microsoft provides regular updates on the progress of SFI.

## Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)

The Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) introduces security best practices, tools, and processes throughout all phases of engineering and development.

## OneFuzz service

A range of tools and techniques - such as threat modeling, static analysis, fuzz testing, and code quality checks - enable continued security value to be embedded into Windows by every engineer on the team from day one. Through the SDL practices, Microsoft engineers are continuously provided with actionable and up-to-date methods to improve development workflows and overall product security before the code is released.

## Microsoft Offensive Research and Security Engineering

Microsoft Offensive Research and Security Engineering (MORSE) performs targeted design reviews, audits, and deep penetration testing of Windows features using Microsoft's open-source OneFuzz platform as part of their development and testing cycle.

## Windows Insider and Bug Bounty program

As part of our secure development process, the Microsoft Windows Insider Preview bounty program invites eligible researchers across the globe to find and submit vulnerabilities that reproduce in the latest Windows Insider Preview (WIP) Dev Channel.

The goal of the Windows Insider Preview bounty program is to uncover significant vulnerabilities that have a direct and demonstrable impact on the security of customers using the latest version of Windows.

Through this collaboration with researchers across the globe, our teams identify critical vulnerabilities and quickly fix the issues before releasing our final Windows.
