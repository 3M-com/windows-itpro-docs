summary: Emerging technologies and evolving business trends bring new opportunities and challenges for organizations of all sizes. As technology and workstyles transform, so does the threat landscape with growing numbers of increasingly sophisticated attacks on organizations and employees. To thrive, organizations need security to work anywhere. Microsoft's 2022 Work Trend Index shows *cybersecurity issues and risks* are top concerns for business decision-makers, who worry about issues like malware, stolen credentials, devices that lack security updates, and physical attacks on lost or stolen devices. In the past, a corporate network and software-based security were the first lines of defense. With an increasingly distributed and mobile workforce, attention has shifted to hardware based endpoint security. People are now the top target for cybercriminals, with 74% of all breaches due to human error, privilege misuses, stolen credentials, or social engineering. Most attacks are financially motivated, and credential theft, phishing, and exploitation of vulnerabilities are the primary attack vectors. Credential theft is the most prevalent attack vector, accounting for 50% of breaches. At Microsoft, we work hard to help organizations evolve and stay agile while protecting against modern threats. We're committed to helping businesses and their employees get secureâ€”and stay secure. We synthesize 43 trillion signals daily to understand and protect against digital threats. We have more than 8,500 dedicated security professionals across 77 countries and over 15,000 partners in our security ecosystem striving to increase resilience for our customers. Businesses worldwide are moving toward secure-by-design and secure-by-default strategies. With these models, organizations choose products from manufacturers that consider security as a business requirement, not just a technical feature. With a secure-by-default strategy, businesses can proactively reduce risk and exposure to threats across their organization because products are shipped with security features already built in and enabled. To help businesses transform and thrive in a new era, we built Windows 11 to be secure by design and secure by default. Windows 11 devices arrive with more security features enabled out of the box. In contrast, Windows 10 devices came with many safeguards turned off unless enabled by IT or employees. The default security provided by Windows 11 elevates protection without needing to configure settings. In addition, Windows 11 devices have been shown to increase malware resistance without impacting performance. Windows 11 is the most secure Windows ever, built in deep partnership with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and silicon manufacturers. Discover why organizations of all sizes, including 90% of Fortune 500 companies, are taking advantage of the powerful default protection of Windows 11.
