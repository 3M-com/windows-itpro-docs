# Windows and cloud security

*This article provides an overview of cloud services built into Windows 11.*

Today’s workforce has more freedom and mobility than ever before. With the growth of enterprise cloud adoption, increased personal app usage, and increased use of third-party apps, the risk of data exposure is at its highest. Enabling Zero-Trust protection, Windows 11 works with Microsoft cloud services to help organizations strengthen their multi-cloud security infrastructure, protect hybrid cloud workloads, and safeguard sensitive information while controlling access and mitigating threats. 

Windows 11 includes the cloud services that are listed in the following table:

| Service type | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Access to Azure Active Directory | Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a complete cloud identity and access management solution for managing identities and directories, enabling access to applications, and protecting identities from security threats.<br/><br/>With Azure AD, you can manage and secure identities for your employees, partners, and customers to access the applications and services they need. <br/><br/>Windows 11 works seamlessly with Azure Active Directory to provide secure access, identity management, and single sign-on to apps and services from anywhere.<br/><br/>To learn more, see [What is Azure AD?](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) |
| Modern device management (MDM) and Microsoft Endpoint Manager | Windows 11 supports MDM, an enterprise management solution to help you manage your organization's security policies and business applications. MDM enables your security team to manage devices without compromising people's privacy on their personal devices.<br/><br/>Non-Microsoft servers can be used to manage Windows 11 by using industry standard protocols.<br/><br/>To learn more, see [MDM and Windows 11](mdm-windows.md). |
| Microsoft account | When you add your Microsoft Account to Windows 11, you can bring your Windows, Microsoft Edge, and Xbox settings, web page favorites, files, photos, and more across your different devices. Your Microsoft account lets you manage everything all in one place. Keep tabs on your subscriptions and order history, organize your family's digital life, update your privacy and security settings, track the health and safety of your devices, and get rewards. Everything stays with you in the cloud and across devices, including iOS and Android.   |
| OneDrive | OneDrive provides extra security, backup, and restore options for your important files and photos. With options for both personal and business, OneDrive stores and protects your files in the cloud, allowing you to access them from your laptop, desktop, and mobile devices. Plus, OneDrive provides an excellent backup and restore solution. If your device is lost or stolen, you can quickly recover all your important files, photos, and data. <br/><br/>OneDrive also provides protection for your most sensitive files without losing the convenience of anywhere access. Protect digital copies of your passport, driver’s license, and other important documents in OneDrive Personal Vault. Your files will be secured by identity verification, yet easily accessible to you across your devices. <br/><br/>Learn how to set up your Personal Vault with a strong authentication method or a second step of identity verification, such as your fingerprint, face, PIN, or a code sent to you via email or SMS. <br/><br/>In the event of a ransomware attack, OneDrive can enable recovery. And if you’ve configured backups in OneDrive, you have more options to mitigate and recover from a ransomware attack. Learn more about how to recover from a ransomware attack using Office 365 |
| Family safety | Microsoft Family Safety empowers you and your family to create healthy habits and protect your loved ones, both online and offline. Get peace of mind that your family is safer while giving your kids independence.<br/><br/>Use your Microsoft account to create a family group on Windows, Xbox, or your mobile devices. Then customize your family settings as your needs change, from the family.microsoft.com website or the Microsoft Family Safety app on Android and iOS.<br/><br/>Develop healthy digital habits with transparency into your family's activities. View your kids’ weekly activity, including web, search, apps and games, and screen time. Balance their time online by setting screen time limits across Windows and Xbox, or set time limits on specific apps or games on Windows, Xbox, or Android to enable kids to be connected for online learning but stay focused. <br/><br/>Create a safe space for your kids to explore online. Use the content filtering settings to block inappropriate apps and games, and limit browsing to kid-friendly websites using Microsoft Edge on Windows, Xbox, and Android. To avoid surprises, get notified when your kids want to download a more mature app or game from the Microsoft Store on Windows and Xbox with age limits.<br/><br/>Stay connected even when you’re apart with family location sharing and tracking. Share your location with loved ones, spot them on a map, and save places they visit the most. <br/><br/>Learn more about Microsoft Family Safety.   |
