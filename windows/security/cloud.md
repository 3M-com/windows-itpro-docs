# Windows and cloud security

*This article provides an overview of cloud services built into Windows 11.*

Todayâ€™s workforce has more freedom and mobility than ever before. With the growth of enterprise cloud adoption, increased personal app usage, and increased use of third-party apps, the risk of data exposure is at its highest. Enabling Zero-Trust protection, Windows 11 works with Microsoft cloud services to help organizations strengthen their multi-cloud security infrastructure, protect hybrid cloud workloads, and safeguard sensitive information while controlling access and mitigating threats. 

Windows 11 includes the cloud services that are listed in the following table:

| Service type | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Access to Azure Active Directory | Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a complete cloud identity and access management solution for managing identities and directories, enabling access to applications, and protecting identities from security threats.<br/><br/>With Azure AD, you can manage and secure identities for your employees, partners, and customers to access the applications and services they need. <br/><br/>Windows 11 works seamlessly with Azure Active Directory to provide secure access, identity management, and single sign-on to apps and services from anywhere.<br/><br/>To learn more, see [What is Azure AD?](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) |
| Modern device management (MDM) and Microsoft Endpoint Manager | Windows 11 supports MDM, an enterprise management solution to help you manage your organization's security policies and business applications. MDM enables your security team to manage devices without compromising people's privacy on their personal devices.<br/><br/>Non-Microsoft servers can be used to manage Windows 11 by using industry standard protocols.<br/><br/>Learn more about MDM and Windows 11 |
