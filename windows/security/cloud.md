# Windows and cloud security

Todayâ€™s workforce has more freedom and mobility than ever before. With the growth of enterprise cloud adoption, increased personal app usage, and increased 3rd party apps, the risk of data exposure is at its highest. Enabling Zero-Trust protection, Windows 11 works with Microsoft cloud services to help organizations strengthen their multi-cloud security infrastructure, protect hybrid cloud workloads and safeguard sensitive information while controlling access and mitigating threats.
