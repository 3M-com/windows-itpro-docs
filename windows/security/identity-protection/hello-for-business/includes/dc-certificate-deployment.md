<summary><b>Configure automatic certificate enrollment for the domain controllers</b></summary>

Domain controllers automatically request a certificate from the *Domain controller certificate* template. However, domain controllers are unaware of newer certificate templates or superseded configurations on certificate templates. To continue automatic enrollment and renewal of domain controller certificates, create and configure a Group Policy Object (GPO) for automatic certificate enrollment, linking the Group Policy object to the *Domain Controllers* Organizational Unit (OU).

1. Open the **Group Policy Management Console** (gpmc.msc)
1. Expand the domain and select the **Group Policy Object** node in the navigation pane
1. Right-click **Group Policy object** and select **New**
1. Type *Domain Controller Auto Certificate Enrollment* in the name box and select **OK**
1. Right-click the **Domain Controller Auto Certificate Enrollment** Group Policy object and select **Edit**
1. In the navigation pane, expand **Policies** under **Computer Configuration**
1. Expand **Windows Settings > Security Settings > Public Key Policies**
1. In the details pane, right-click **Certificate Services Client - Auto-Enrollment** and select **Properties**
1. Select **Enabled** from the **Configuration Model** list
1. Select the **Renew expired certificates, update pending certificates, and remove revoked certificates** check box
1. Select the **Update certificates that use certificate templates** check box
1. Select **OK**
1. Close the **Group Policy Management Editor**
