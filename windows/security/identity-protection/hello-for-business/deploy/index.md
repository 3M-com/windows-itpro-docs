# Plan a Windows Hello for Business deployment

This planning guide helps you understand the different topologies, architectures, and components that encompass a Windows Hello for Business infrastructure.

This guide explains the role of each component within Windows Hello for Business and how certain deployment decisions affect other aspects of the infrastructure.

> [!TIP]
> If you have a Microsoft Entra ID tenant, you can use our online, interactive Passwordless Wizard which walks through the same choices instead of using our manual guide below. The Passwordless Wizard is available in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/modernonboarding/passwordlesssetup).

## Using this guide

There are many options from which you can choose when deploying Windows Hello for Business. Providing multiple options ensures nearly every organization can deploy Windows Hello for Business. Providing many options makes the deployment appear complex. However, most organization will realize they've already implemented most of the infrastructure on which the Windows Hello for Business deployment depends. It's important to understand that Windows Hello for Business is a distributed system and does take proper planning across multiple teams within an organization.

This guide removes the appearance of complexity by helping you make decisions on each aspect of your Windows Hello for Business deployment and the options you need to consider. Using this guide also identifies the information needed to help you make decisions about the deployment that best suits your environment.

### How to proceed

Read this document and record your decisions. When finished, you should have all the necessary information to evaluate the available options and to determine requirements for your Windows Hello for Business deployment.

There are eight major categories to consider when planning a Windows Hello for Business deployment:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - [Deployment options](#deployment-options)
> - [Public Key Infrastructure](#public-key-infrastructure-pki)
> - [Authentication](#authentication)
> - [Device configuration](#device-configuration)
> - [Licensing for cloud services](#licensing-for-cloud-services)
> - [Windows requirements](#windows-requirements)
> - [Windows Server requirements](#windows-server-requirements)
> - [Prepare users to use Windows Hello](#prepare-users-to-use-windows-hello)

## Deployment options

The goal of Windows Hello for Business is to enable deployments for all organizations of any size or scenario. To provide this type of granular deployment, Windows Hello for Business offers a diverse choice of deployment options.

### Deployment models

It's fundamentally important to understand which deployment model to use for a successful deployment. Some aspects of the deployment might have already been decided for you based on your current infrastructure.

There are three deployment models from which you can choose:

|| Deployment model | Description |
|--|--|--|
|     **ðŸ”²**| **Cloud-only** | For organizations that only have cloud identities and don't access on-premises resources. These organizations typically join their devices to the cloud and exclusively use resources in the cloud such as SharePoint Online, OneDrive, and others. Also, since the users don't use on-premises resources, they don't need certificates for things like VPN because everything they need is hosted in cloud services. |
|     **ðŸ”²**| **Hybrid** | For organizations that have identities synchronized from Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID. These organizations use applications registered in Microsoft Entra ID, and want a single sign-on (SSO) experience for both on-premises and Microsoft Entra resources. |
|     **ðŸ”²**| **On-premises** | For organizations that don't have cloud identities or use applications hosted in Microsoft Entra ID. These organizations use on-premises applications, integrated in Active Directory, and want an SSO user experiences when accessing them. |

>[!NOTE]
>
>- Main use case of On-Premises deployment is for "Enhanced Security Administrative Environments" also known as "Red Forests"
>- Migration from on-premise to hybrid deployment requires redeployment

### Trust types

A deployment's trust type defines how Windows Hello for Business clients **authenticate to Active Directory**. The trust type doesn't affect authentication to Microsoft Entra ID. For this reason, the trust type isn't applicable to a cloud-only deployment model.

Windows Hello for Business authentication to Microsoft Entra ID always uses the key, not a certificate (excluding smart card authentication in a federated environment).

The trust type determines whether you issue authentication certificates to your users. One trust model isn't more secure than the other.

The deployment of certificates to users and Domain Controllers requires more configuration and infrastructure, which could also be a factor to consider in your decision. More infrastructure needed for certificate-trust deployments includes a certificate registration authority. In a federated environment, you must activate the Device Writeback option in Microsoft Entra Connect.

There are three trust types from which you can choose:

|| Trust type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| **ðŸ”²**| **Cloud Kerberos**| Users authenticate to Active Directory by requesting a TGT from Microsoft Entra ID, using Microsoft Entra Kerberos. The on-premises domain controllers are still responsible for Kerberos service tickets and authorization. Cloud Kerberos trust uses the same infrastructure required for FIDO2 security key sign-in, and it can be used for new or existing Windows Hello for Business deployments. |
| **ðŸ”²**| **Key**| Users authenticate to the on-premises Active Directory using a device-bound key (hardware or software) created during the Windows Hello provisioning experience. It requires to distribute certificates to domain controllers. |
| **ðŸ”²**| **Certificate**| The certificate trust type issues authentication certificates to users. Users authenticate using a certificate requested using a device-bound key (hardware or software) created during the Windows Hello provisioning experience. |

*Key trust* and *certificate trust* use certificate authentication-based Kerberos when requesting kerberos ticket-granting-tickets (TGTs) for on-premises authentication. This type of authentication requires a PKI for DC certificates, and requires end-user certificates for certificate trust.

The goal of Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust is to provide a simpler deployment experience, when compared to the other trust types:

- No need to deploy a public key infrastructure (PKI) or to change an existing PKI
- No need to synchronize public keys between Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory for users to access on-premises resources. There isn't any delay between the user's Windows Hello for Business provisioning, and being able to authenticate to Active Directory
- [FIDO2 security key sign-in][ENTRA-1] can be deployed with minimal extra setup

> [!TIP]
> Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust is the recommended deployment model when compared to the *key trust model*. It is also the preferred deployment model if you do not need to support certificate authentication scenarios.

Cloud Kerberos trust requires the deployment of Microsoft Entra Kerberos. For more information about how Microsoft Entra Kerberos enables access to on-premises resources, see [enabling passwordless security key sign-in to on-premises resources][ENTRA-1].

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

Cloud Kerberos trust is the only hybrid deployment option that doesn't require the deployment of any certificates. The other hybrid and on-premises models depend on an enterprise PKI as a trust anchor for authentication:

- Domain controllers for hybrid and on-premises deployments need a certificate for Windows devices to trust the domain controller as legitimate
- Deployments using the certificate trust type require an enterprise PKI and a certificate registration authority (CRA) to issue authentication certificates to users. AD FS is used as a CRA
- Hybrid deployments might need to issue VPN certificates to users to enable connectivity on-premises resources

|| Deployment model | Trust type | PKI required? |
|--|--|--|--|
|    **ðŸ”²** | **Cloud-only** | n/a | no |
|    **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Cloud Kerberos | no |
|    **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Key | yes |
|    **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Certificate | yes |
|    **ðŸ”²** | **On-premises** | Key | yes |
|    **ðŸ”²** | **On-premises** | Certificate | yes |

## Authentication

Here are some core concepts regarding authentication to Microsoft Entra ID:

:::row:::
:::row:::
    :::column span="1":::
        **Password hash sync (PHS)**
    :::column-end:::    
    :::colum span="3":::
        Password hash sync is the simplest way to enable authentication for on-premises directory objects in Microsoft Entra ID. With PHS, you synchronize your on-premises Active Directory user account objects with Microsoft Entra ID and manage your users on-premises. Hashes of user passwords are synchronized from your on-premises Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID so that the users have the same password on-premises and in the cloud. When passwords are changed or reset on-premises, the new password hashes are synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID so that your users can always use the same password for cloud resources and on-premises resources. The passwords are never sent to Microsoft Entra ID or stored in Microsoft Entra ID in clear text. Some premium features of Microsoft Entra ID, such as Identity Protection, require PHS regardless of which authentication method is selected. With seamless single sign-on, users are automatically signed in to Microsoft Entra ID when they are on their corporate devices and connected to your corporate network.

    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
    :::column span="1":::
        **Pass-through authentication (PTA)**
    :::column-end:::    
    :::colum span="3":::
        Pass-through authentication provides a simple password validation for Microsoft Entra authentication services. It uses a software agent that runs on one or more on-premises servers to validate the users directly with your on-premises Active Directory. With pass-through authentication (PTA), you synchronize on-premises Active Directory user account objects with Microsoft Entra ID and manage your users on-premises. Allows your users to sign in to both on-premises and Microsoft cloud resources and applications using their on-premises account and password. This configuration validates users' passwords directly against your on-premises Active Directory without sending password hashes to Microsoft Entra ID. Companies with a security requirement to immediately enforce on-premises user account states, password policies, and sign-in hours would use this authentication method. With seamless single sign-on, users are automatically signed in to Microsoft Entra ID when they are on their corporate devices and connected to your corporate network.

    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
    :::column span="1":::
        **Cloud authentication**
    :::column-end:::    
    :::colum span="3":::
        Cloud authentication is for environments where Microsoft Entra ID manages the authentication using technologies such as Password Hash Synchronization and Pass-through Authentication, rather than a federation service like Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
    :::column span="1":::
        **Federated authentication**
    :::column-end:::    
    :::colum span="3":::
        Federated authentication is for environments where Microsoft Entra ID hands off the authentication process to a separate trusted authentication system, such as on-premises Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), to validate the user's credential. The authentication system can provide other advanced authentication requirements, for example, third-party multifactor authentication.
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

Here's a list of requirements for federated and nonfederated deployments.

|| Deployment model | Trust type | Authentication to Microsoft Entra ID | Requirements |
|--|--|--|--|--|
|    **ðŸ”²** | **Cloud-only** | n/a | Cloud authentication | n/a |
|    **ðŸ”²** | **Cloud-only** | n/a | Federated authentication | third-party federation service |
|    **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Cloud Kerberos trust | Cloud authentication | Microsoft Entra Kerberos |
|    **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Key trust | Cloud authentication | PHS or PTA|
|    **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Key trust | Federated authentication | AD FS or third-party federation service. Key trust with federated authentication doesn't support PTA or PHS |
|    **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Certificate trust | non-federated | AD FS |
|    **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Certificate trust | federated | AD FS |

### Device registration

All devices included in the Windows Hello for Business deployment must go through a process called *device registration*. Device registration enables devices to be associated and to authentiticate to an identity provider (IdP). Device registration is identified by the *join type*.

- Registering a device to Microsoft Entra ID enables you to manage a device's identity. When a device is registered, Microsoft Entra provides the device with an identity that is used to authenticate the device when a user signs-in to Microsoft Entra ID. You can use the identity to enable or disable a device. When combined with a mobile device management (MDM) solution such as Microsoft Intune, the device attributes in Microsoft Entra ID are updated with additional information about the device. This behavior allows you to create conditional access rules that enforce access from devices to meet your standards for security and compliance
- Joining a device to Microsoft Entra ID is an extension to registering a device. This method provides you with all the benefits of registering a device, and changes the local state of a device. Changing the local state enables your users to sign-in to a device using an organizational work or school account, instead of a personal account

For on-premises deployments, the server running the Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) role is responsible for device registration. For cloud-only and hybrid deployments, devices must register in Microsoft Entra ID.

| Deployment model | Supported join type | Device registration service provider |
|-|-|-|
| **Cloud-only** |Microsoft Entra joined<br>Microsoft Entra registered|Microsoft Entra ID |
| **Hybrid** |Microsoft Entra joined<br>Microsoft Entra hybrid joined<br>Microsoft Entra registered|Microsoft Entra ID|
| **On-premises** | Active Directory domain joined | AD FS |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For *Microsoft Entra hybrid joined* guidance, review [Plan your Microsoft Entra hybrid join implementation][ENTRA-5].

### Key registration

The built-in Windows Hello for Business provisioning experience creates a device-bound asymmetric key pair as the user's credentials. The private key is protected by the device's security modules. The credential is a *user key*, not a *device key*. The provisioning experience registers the user's public key with the identity provider:

| Deployment model | Key registration service provider |
|-|-|
| **Cloud-only** | Microsoft Entra ID |
| **Hybrid** | Microsoft Entra ID |
| **On-premises** | AD FS |

### Directory synchronization

Hybrid and on-premises deployments use directory synchronization, however, each for a different purpose:

- Hybrid deployments use [Microsoft Entra Connect Sync][ENTRA-3] to synchronize Active Directory identities (users and devices) or credentials between itself and Microsoft Entra ID. During the Window Hello for Business provisioning process, users register the public portion of their Windows Hello for Business credential with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra Connect Sync synchronizes the Windows Hello for Business public key to Active Directory. This synchronization enables SSO to Microsoft Entra ID and its federated components.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Windows Hello for Business is tied between a user and a device. Both the user and device object must be synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory.
- On-premises deployments use directory synchronization to import users from Active Directory to the Azure MFA server, which sends data to the MFA cloud service to perform the verification

| Deployment model | Directory sync options |
|-|-|
| **Cloud-only** | n/a |
| **Hybrid** | Microsoft Entra Connect Sync|
| **On-premises** | Azure MFA server |

### Multifactor authentication

The goal of Windows Hello for Business is to move organizations away from passwords by providing them with a *strong credential* that enables easy two-factor authentication. The built-in provisioning experience accepts the user's weak credentials (username and password) as the first factor authentication. However, the user must provide a second factor of authentication before Windows provisions a strong credential:

- For cloud-only and hybrid deployments, there are different choices for multifactor authentication, including [Microsoft Entra MFA][ENTRA-1]
- On-premises deployments must use a multifactor option that can integrate as an AD FS multifactor adapter. Organizations can choose from third-party options that offer an AD FS MFA adapter. For more information, see [Microsoft and third-party additional authentication methods][SER-2]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of July 1, 2019, Microsoft doesn't offer MFA Server for new deployments. New deployments that require multifactor authentication should use cloud-based Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication. Existing deployment where the MFA Server was activated prior to July 1, 2019 can download the latest version, future updates, and generate activation credentials. For more information, see [Getting started with the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server][ENTRA-2].

|| Deployment model | MFA options |
|--|--|--|
| **ðŸ”²** | **Cloud-only** | Microsoft Entra MFA |
| **ðŸ”²** | **Cloud-only** | Third-party MFA via Microsoft Entra ID custom controls or federation |
| **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Microsoft Entra MFA |
| **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Third-party MFA via Microsoft Entra ID custom controls or federation|
| **ðŸ”²** | **On-premises** | AD FS MFA adapter |

For more information how to configure Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication, see [Configure Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication settings][ENTRA-4].

For more information how to configure AD FS to provide multifactor authentication, see [Configure Azure MFA as authentication provider with AD FS][SER-1].

#### MFA and federated authentication

It's possible for federated domains to configure the *FederatedIdpMfaBehavior* flag. The flag instructs Microsoft Entra ID to accept, enforce, or reject the MFA challenge from the federated IdP. For more information, see [federatedIdpMfaBehavior values](/graph/api/resources/internaldomainfederation#federatedidpmfabehavior-values). To check this setting, use the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Connect-MgGraph
$DomainId = "<your federated domain name>"
Get-MgDomainFederationConfiguration -DomainId $DomainId |fl
```

To reject the MFA claim from the federated IdP, use the following command. This change impacts all MFA scenarios for the federated domain:

```powershell
Update-MgDomainFederationConfiguration -DomainId $DomainId -FederatedIdpMfaBehavior rejectMfaByFederatedIdp
```

If you configure the flag with a value of either `acceptIfMfaDoneByFederatedIdp` (default) or `enforceMfaByFederatedIdp`, you must verify that your federated IDP is correctly configured and working with the MFA adapter and provider used by your IdP.

## Device configuration

Windows Hello for Business provides organizations with a rich set of granular policy settings with which they can use to configure their devices. There are two main options to configure Windows Hello for Business: configuration service provider (CSP) and group policy (GPO).

- The CSP option is ideal for devices that are managed through a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution, like Microsoft Intune. CSPs can also be configured with [provisioning packages](/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/how-it-pros-can-use-configuration-service-providers#csps-in-windows-configuration-designer)
- GPO can be used to configure domain joined devices and where devices aren't managed via MDM

|| Deployment model | Device configuration options|
|--|--|--|
| **ðŸ”²** | **Cloud-only** | CSP |
| **ðŸ”²** | **Cloud-only** | GPO (local) |
| **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | CSP |
| **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | GPO (Active Directory or local) |
| **ðŸ”²** | **On-premises** | CSP |
| **ðŸ”²** | **On-premises** | GPO (Active Directory or local) |

## Licensing for cloud services

Here are some considerations regarding licensing requirements for cloud services:

- Windows Hello for Business doesn't require a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 subscription. However, some dependencies, such as [MDM automatic enrollment](/mem/intune/enrollment/quickstart-setup-auto-enrollment) and [Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) do
  - Devices managed via MDM don't require a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 subscription. By forgoing the subscription, users must manually enroll devices in the MDM solution, such as Microsoft Intune or a supported third-party MDM
- You can deploy Windows Hello for Business using the Microsoft Entra ID Free tier. All Microsoft Entra ID Free accounts can use Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication for the Windows passwordless features
  - Some Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication features require a license. For more information, see [Features and licenses for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-licensing).
- Enrolling a certificate using the AD FS registration authority requires devices to authenticate to the AD FS server, which requires device write-back, a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 feature

|| Deployment model | Trust type | Cloud services licenses (minimum)|
|--|--|--|--|
| **ðŸ”²** | **Cloud-only** | n/a | not required |
| **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Cloud Kerberos | not required |
| **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Key| not required |
| **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Certificate | Microsoft Entra ID P1 |
| **ðŸ”²** | **On-premises** | Key | Azure MFA, if used as MFA solution |
| **ðŸ”²** | **On-premises** | Certificate | Azure MFA, if used as MFA solution |

## Windows requirements

All supported Windows 10 and Windows 11 versions can be used with Windows Hello for Business. However, cloud Kerberos trust requires minimum versions:

|| Deployment model | Trust type | Windows version|
|--|--|--|--|
| **ðŸ”²** | **Cloud-only** | n/a | All supported versions |
| **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Cloud Kerberos | - Windows 10 21H2, with [KB5010415][KB-1] and later<br>- Windows 11 21H2, with [KB5010414][KB-2] and later |
| **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Key | All supported versions |
| **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid** | Certificate | All supported versions |
| **ðŸ”²** | **On-premises** | Key| All supported versions |
| **ðŸ”²** | **On-premises** | Certificate | All supported versions |
## Windows Server requirements

All supported Windows Server versions can be used with Windows Hello for Business as Domain Controller. However, cloud Kerberos trust requires minimum versions:

|| Deployment model | Trust type     | Domain Controller OS version                                                                              |
|-----------------------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ðŸ”²** | **Cloud-only**   | n/a            | All supported versions                                                                                    |
| **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid**       | Cloud Kerberos | - Windows Server 2016, [KB3534307][KB-3]<br>- Windows Server 2019, [KB4534321][KB-4], Windows Server 2022 |
| **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid**       | Key            | All supported versions                                                                                    |
| **ðŸ”²** | **Hybrid**       | Certificate    | All supported versions                                                                                    |
| **ðŸ”²** | **On-premises**  | Key            | All supported versions                                                                                    |
| **ðŸ”²** | **On-premises**  | Certificate    | All supported versions                                                                                    |

## Prepare users to use Windows Hello

When you enable Windows Hello for Business in your organization, make sure to prepare the users by explaining how to enroll and use Windows Hello.

Ensure you have a strategy in place to ensure the users have an MFA option that is easy to use during enrollment.

Depending on the hardware, users might be prompted to register their fingerprint or face.

The next video shows the Windows Hello for Business enrollment experience after a user signs in with a password:

1. Since the device supports biometric authentication, the user is prompted to set up a biometric gesture. This gesture can be used to unlock the device and authenticate to resources that require Windows Hello for Business. The user can skip this step if they don't want to set up a biometric gesture
1. The user is prompted to use Windows Hello with the organization account. The user selects **OK**
1. The provisioning flow proceeds to the multi-factor authentication portion of the enrollment. Provisioning informs the user that it's actively attempting to contact the user through their configured form of MFA. The provisioning process doesn't proceed until authentication succeeds, fails or times out. A failed or timeout MFA results in an error and asks the user to retry
1. After a successful MFA, the provisioning flow asks the user to create and validate a PIN. This PIN must observe any PIN complexity policies configured on the device

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=36dc8679-0fcc-4abf-868d-97ec8b749da7 alt-text="Video showing the Windows Hello for Business enrollment steps after signing in with a password."]

After enrollment in Windows Hello, users should use their gesture (such as a PIN or fingerprint) for access to their devices and corporate resources. The unlock gesture is valid only on the enrolled device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although the organization might require users to change their Active Directory or Microsoft Entra account password at regular intervals, changes to their passwords have no effect on Hello.

The next video shows the Windows Hello for Business enrollment experience as part of the out-of-box-experience (OOBE) process:

1. The user joins the device to Microsoft Entra ID and is prompted for MFA during the join process
1. The device is Managed by Microsoft Intune and applies Windows Hello for Business policy settings
1. After the user profile is loaded, but before the access to the desktop is granted, the user must enroll in Windows Hello
