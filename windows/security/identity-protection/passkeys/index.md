## Overview

Passkeys are a simple and more secure replacement for passwords when you sign into a web site or application that supports them. Passkeys are phish-resistant, recoverable, and faster to use than passwords.

Starting in Windows 11, version 22H2 with [KB5030310][KB-1], you can use any apps or websites that supports passkeys to create and sign in using passkeys with the Windows Hello native experience. Once a passkey is created, you can use Windows Hello (biometrics and PIN) or a companion device (phone or tablet) to sign in.

## System requirements

Windows provides a native experience for passkey management starting in Windows 11, version 22H2 with [KB5030310][KB-1].

## User experiences

### Create a passkey

The general steps to create a passkey are the same, regardless of *where* you want to store it:

1. Go to a website or app that supports passkeys
1. Create a passkey from your account settings

    - Locally on your Windows device, protected by Windows Hello (biometrics and PIN). This is the default option, if you're using a Windows device with Windows Hello or Windows Hello for Business enabled
    - On a phone or tablet, protected by the device's biometrics, if offered by the device. This option requires you to scan a QR code with your phone or tablet
    - To a *linked* device (typically a phone or tablet), protected by the device's biometrics, if offered by the device. This option requires the linked device to be connected via Bluetooth to the Windows device
    - On a security key (FIDO2 key), protected by the key's biometrics, if offered by the key

  3. Choose where to save the passkey. By default, Windows prompts to save the passkey locally if you're using Windows Hello or Windows Hello for Business. If you select the option **Use another device**, you can choose to save the passkey on one of the following locations:

      - **This Windows device** - the passkey is saved locally on your Windows device, and protected by Windows Hello (biometrics and PIN)
      - **iPhone, iPad or Android device** - the passkey is stored on a phone or tablet, protected by the device's biometrics, if offered by the device. This option requires you to scan a QR code with your phone or tablet
      - **linked device** - the key is stored on a *linked* device typically a phone or tablet, protected by the device's biometrics, if offered by the device. This option requires the linked device to be connected via Bluetooth to the Windows device
      - **Security key** - the passkey is saved to a security key (FIDO2 key), protected by the key's biometrics, if offered by the key
