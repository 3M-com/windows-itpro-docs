  3. Choose where to save the passkey. By default, Windows offers to save the passkey locally if you're using Windows Hello or Windows Hello for Business. If you select the option **Use another device**, you can choose to save the passkey in one of the following locations:
        - **This Windows device**: the passkey is saved locally on your Windows device, and protected by Windows Hello (biometrics and PIN)
        - **iPhone, iPad or Android device**: the passkey is saved on a phone or tablet, protected by the device's biometrics, if offered by the device. This option requires you to scan a QR code with your phone or tablet, which must be in proximity of the Windows device
        - **Linked device**: the passkey is saved on a phone or tablet, protected by the device's biometrics, if offered by the device. This option requires the linked device to be in proximity of the Windows device, and it's only supported for Android devices
        - **Security key**: the passkey is saved to a FIDO2 security key, protected by the key's unlock mechanism (for example, biometrics or PIN)
