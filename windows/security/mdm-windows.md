# Modern device management and Windows 11

Windows 11 supports MDM, an enterprise management solution to help you manage your organization's security policies and business applications. MDM enables your security team to manage devices without compromising people's privacy on their personal devices.

Windows 11 includes a management component that includes:
- The enrollment client, which enrolls and configures the endpoint to communicate with the enterprise management server; and
- The management client, which periodically synchronizes with the management server to check for updates and apply your security team's latest policies.

MDM includes several security features & capabilities. These include:
- Remote wipe
- Support for your work or school account
- Config Lock
- Remote device attestation
- (other stuff coming soon): Device Installation, DMA Guard, Endpoint Detection and Response, the Microsoft Defender Security Center, Smartscreen, System Guard, and Windows Hello for Business

Non-Microsoft servers can be used to manage Windows 11 by using industry standard protocols.
