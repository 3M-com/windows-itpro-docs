# Windows application security

Cybercriminals regularly gain access to valuable data by hacking poorly secured applications. Common security failures include “code injection” attacks, in which attackers insert malicious code that can tamper with data, or even destroy it. An application may have its security misconfigured, leaving open doors for hackers. Or vital customer and corporate information may leave sensitive data exposed. Windows 11 protects your valuable data with layers of application security. A rich application platform, isolation, and code integrity enables developers to build-in security from the ground up to protect against breaches and malware.
