## Passwordless Sign In

| Security Measures | Features & Capabilities |
|:---|:---|
| **[Windows Hello for Business](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business)** |  |
| **[Windows presence sensing](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/wake-your-windows-11-pc-when-you-approach-82285c93-440c-4e15-9081-c9e38c1290bb)** | Windows presence sensing provides another layer of data security protection for hybrid workers. Windows 11 devices can intelligently adapt to your presence to help you stay secure and productive, whether you’re working at home, the office, or a public environment. Windows presence sensing combines presence detection sensors with Windows Hello facial recognition to automatically lock your device when you leave, and then unlock your device and sign you in using Windows Hello facial recognition when you return. Requires OEM supporting hardware. |
| **[Windows Hello for Business Enhanced Security Sign-in (ESS) ](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/windows-hello-enhanced-sign-in-security)** | Windows Hello biometrics also supports enhanced sign-in security, which uses specialized hardware and software components to raise the security bar even higher for biometric sign in. Enhanced Sign-in Security is configured by device manufacturers during the manufacturing process. Enhanced sign-in security biometrics uses VBS and the TPM to isolate user authentication processes and data and secure the pathway by which the information is communicated. These specialized components protect against a class of attacks that include biometric sample injection, replay, tampering, and more.<br><br>For example, fingerprint readers must implement Secure Device Connection Protocol, which uses key negotiation and a Microsoft issued certificate to protect and securely store user authentication data. <br><br>For facial recognition, components such as the Secure Devices (SDEV) table and process isolation with trustlets help prevent additional class of attacks. For facial recognition, Enhanced Sign-in Security is supported by Intel USB and AMD USB processor/camera combinations including specific modules from manufacturers. Intel MIPI is supported starting with version Windows 11 2022 Update.  |
| **[Fast Identity Online (FIDO2) security key](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key)** | Fast Identity Online (FIDO) defined CTAP and WebAuthN specifications are becoming the open standard for providing strong authentication that is non-phishable, user-friendly, and privacy-respecting with implementations from major platform providers and relying parties. FIDO standards and certifications are becoming recognized as the leading standard for creating secure authentication solutions across enterprises, governments, and consumer markets. Windows 11 can use external FIDO2 security keys for authentication alongside or in addition to Windows Hello which is also a FIDO2 certified passwordless solution. Windows 11 can be used as a FIDO authenticator for many popular identity management services. |
| **[Federated sign-in](/education/windows/federated-sign-in)** | Windows 11 supports federated sign in with external education identity management services. For students unable to type easily or remember complex passwords, this capability enables secure sign in through methods like QR codes or pictures. |
| **[Smart Cards for Windows Service](/windows/security/identity-protection/smart-cards/smart-card-smart-cards-for-windows-service)** | Organizations also have the option of using smart cards, an authentication method that pre-dates biometric sign in. Smart cards are tamper-resistant, portable storage devices that can enhance Windows security when authenticating clients, signing code, securing e-mail, and signing in with Windows domain accounts. Smart cards can only be used to sign into domain accounts, not local accounts. When a password is used to sign into a domain account, Windows uses the Kerberos version 5 (v5) protocol for authentication. If you use a smart card, the operating system uses Kerberos v5 authentication with X.509 v3 certificates. |

## Advanced Credential Protection

| Security Measures | Features & Capabilities |
|:---|:---|
| **[Windows LAPS](/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-overview)** |  |
| **[Account Lockout Policy](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/account-lockout-policy)** |  |
| **[Enhanced phishing protection with SmartScreen](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/phishing-protection-microsoft-defender-smartscreen)** | People who are still using passwords can benefit from powerful credential protection in Windows 11. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen now includes enhanced phishing protection to automatically detect when you enter your Microsoft password into any app or website. Windows then identifies if the app or site is securely authenticating to Microsoft and warns if your credentials are at risk. Because you are alerted at the moment of potential credential theft, you can take pre-emptive action before your password is used against you or your organization. |
| **[Access Control (ACLs/SCALS)](/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/access-control)** | Access control in Windows help ensure that shared resources are available to users and groups in addition to the resource owner and are protected from unauthorized use. IT administrators can manage users’, groups’, and computers’ access to objects and assets on a network or computer. After a user is authenticated, the Windows operating system implements the second phase of protecting resources by using built-in authorization and access control technologies to determine if an authenticated user has the correct permissions. Access Control Lists (ACL) describe the permissions for a specific object and can also contain System Access Control Lists (SACL). SACLs provide a way to audit specific system level events, such as when a user attempt to access file system objects. These events are essential for tracking activity for objects that are sensitive or valuable and require extra monitoring. Being able to audit when a resource attempts to read or write part of the operating system is critical to understanding a potential attack. |

| **[Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard](/windows/security/identity-protection/remote-credential-guard)** |  |
