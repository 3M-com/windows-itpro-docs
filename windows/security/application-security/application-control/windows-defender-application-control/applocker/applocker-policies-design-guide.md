# AppLocker design guide

This article for the IT professional introduces the design and planning steps required to deploy application control policies by using AppLocker.

This guide provides important designing and planning information for deploying application control policies by using AppLocker. Through a sequential and iterative process, you can create an AppLocker policy deployment plan for your organization that addresses your specific application control requirements by department, organizational unit, or business group.

To understand if AppLocker is the correct application control solution for your organization, see [Windows Defender Application Control and AppLocker overview](/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/wdac-and-applocker-overview).
