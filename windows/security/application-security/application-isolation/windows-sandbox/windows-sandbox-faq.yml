title: Common questions about Windows Sandbox
summary: Windows Sandbox (WSB) provides a lightweight desktop environment to safely run applications in isolation. This feature provides a safe and secure space for testing and debugging apps, exploring unknown files, or experimenting with tools since software installed inside the Windows Sandbox environment remains "sandboxed" and runs separately from the host machine.
