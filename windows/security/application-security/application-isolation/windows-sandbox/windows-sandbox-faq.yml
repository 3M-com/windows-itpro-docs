title: Common questions about Windows Sandbox
summary: Windows Sandbox (WSB) provides a lightweight desktop environment to safely run applications in isolation. This feature provides a safe and secure space for testing and debugging apps, exploring unknown files, or experimenting with tools since software installed inside the Windows Sandbox environment remains "sandboxed" and runs separately from the host machine.

      - question: Who can use WSB?
        answer: |
          WSB can be used by anyone without any technical skills in various scenarios where users need a secure, clean environment for testing or running potentially harmful software. Here are some ways in which you can leverage WSB:

          - *Clean environment for software testing*: Test or debug your applications in WSB's clean environment to identify and resolve bugs or compatibility issues.
          - *Secure web browsing*: Use WSB for secure web browsing, especially when accessing unfamiliar or potentially dangerous websites without putting your system at risk of malware infection.
          - *Running Untrusted Applications*: Mitigate security risks by running untrusted applications or files, such as email attachments in WSB.
          - *Test software features risk-free*: Easily test out software without the need for installing or uninstalling on your host machine.
          - *Maintaining multiple dev environments*: Streamline your development process by utilizing WSB to maintain multiple sandboxes for different development environments
          - *Privacy Protection*: Users concerned about online privacy can use Windows Sandbox for activities like social media browsing or online shopping to prevent tracking cookies and other privacy-invading techniques.

      - question: What's the difference between a Hyper-V VM and Windows Sandbox?
        answer: |
          1. **Lightweight and Temporary**:
            - **Windows Sandbox**: It's a lightweight, disposable environment that runs within your existing Windows installation. You can quickly launch it, test applications, and discard it without affecting your main system.
            - **Hyper-V VMs**: Hyper-V VMs are more heavyweight. They require dedicated resources (CPU, memory, disk space) and take longer to set up.
          1. **Security Isolation**:
            - **Windows Sandbox**: Provides a secure, isolated environment for testing untrusted software. Any changes made within the sandbox are discarded when you close it.
            - **Hyper-V VMs**: While VMs also offer isolation, they persistently store changes unless you revert them manually.
          1. **Resource Efficiency**:
            - **Windows Sandbox**: More resource efficient than full VM. It adjusts memory usage according to the demand. It also reuses many of the host’s read only OS files.
            - **Hyper-V VMs**: VMs have fixed resource allocations, which can impact overall system performance.
          1. **Ease of Use**:
            - **Windows Sandbox**: Simple to use—just open it, test your software, and close it. No complex setup or management.
            - **Hyper-V VMs**: Require more configuration, including setting up virtual switches, network adapters, and managing VM snapshots.

      - question: Why can I not change certain settings using a config file?
        answer: |
          You cannot make changes to properties if they are controlled by Group Policy. Contact your IT Administrator for more details.

      - question: How do I open multiple Sandbox instances?
        answer: |
          Today, Windows Sandbox only allows users to launch one Sandbox instance at a time.

  - name: Feedback
    questions:

      - question: Where can I provide feedback?
        answer: |
          You can file a bug in Feedback Hub by:

          1. Open the Feedback Hub app.
          1. Select **Report a problem** or **Suggest a feature**.
          1. Fill in the **Summarize your feedback** and **Explain in more details** boxes with a detailed description of the issue or suggestion. A useful feedback item includes the following:
            - Short and descriptive issue title.
            - Windows version and build number. This can be gathered from the CMD prompt using the `cmd.exe --version`` command.
            - Device information (including CPU type, memory, disk etc.)
            - Detailed repro steps. What steps do we need to take to reproduce the issue? Provide as much detail as you can. Provide error message text where possible or screenshots of errors if text cannot be captured.
            - Behavior you were expecting.
          1. Select an appropriate category and subcategory by using the dropdown menus. There is a dedicated option in Feedback Hub to file **Windows Sandbox** bugs and feedback. It is located under **Security and Privacy** category.
          1. Select **Next**.
          1. If necessary, you can collect traces for the issue as follows: Select the Recreate my problem tile, then select Start capture, reproduce the issue, and then select **Stop capture**.
          1. Attach any relevant screenshots or files for the problem, then select **Submit**.

          Alternatively, you can also use the [Windows Sandbox GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-Sandbox) to:

          - **Search existing issues** to see if there are any associated with a problem that you are having. Note that in the search bar, you can remove "is:open" to include issues that have already been resolved in your search. Please consider commenting or giving a thumbs up to any open issues that you would like to express your interest in moving forward as a priority.
          - **File a new issue**: If you have found a problem with WSB or WSB documentation and there does not appear to be an existing issue, you can select the green New issue button and then choose WSB - Bug Report. You will need to include a title for the issue, your Windows build number (run cmd.exe /c ver to see your current build #), whether you're running inbox or undocked Windows Sandbox, any other software versions involved, the repro steps, expected behavior, actual behavior, and diagnostic logs if available and appropriate.
          - **File a feature request** by selecting the green New issue button and then select Feature request. You will need to address a few questions describing your request.
