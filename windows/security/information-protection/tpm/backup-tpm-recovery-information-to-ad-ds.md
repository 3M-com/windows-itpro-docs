# Backup the TPM recovery information to AD DS

With Windows 11, you can back up a computer's Trusted Platform Module (TPM) information to Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). By doing this, you can use AD DS to administer the TPM from a remote computer. The procedure is the same as it was for Windows 8.1. For more information, see [Backup the TPM Recovery Information to AD DS](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/dn466534(v=ws.11)).
