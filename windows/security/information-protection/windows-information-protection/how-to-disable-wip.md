# How to disable Windows Information Protection (WIP)

_Applies to:_

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

#### purple box

## Use Intune to disable WIP

To remove Windows Information Protection (WIP) using Intune, you have the following options:

#### Option 1 - Remove the WIP Policy (Unassign) - preferred

Removing an existing enable policy will remove the intent to deploy WIP from those devices. When that intent is removed, a device will remove protection for files and the configuration for WIP.

#### Option 2 - Change current WIP policy to off

If youâ€™re currently deploying a WIP policy for enrolled or unenrolled devices, you switch the WIP policy to Off. When devices check-in after this change, the devices will proceed to unprotect files previously protected by WIP.

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager.
1. Open Microsoft Intune and select Apps > App protection policies > 
In Client apps - App protection policies, select <> apps. Select the existing policy to turn off.
1. From App protection policy, select the name of your policy, and then select the name of your properties.
1. Edit required settings.

####  Create a disable policy - write this as a note

You can create a separate disable policy for WIP (both enrolled and unenrolled) and deploy that to your organization. You then stage the rollout by complimenting your existing enablement policy and moving entities slowly from being targeted with enable to the disable policy.
