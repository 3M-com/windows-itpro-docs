# VAMT step-by-step scenarios

This section provides instructions on how to implement the Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT) in typical environments. VAMT supports many common scenarios. To get started, some of the most common scenarios are described here.

## In this section

|Article |Description |
|-------|------------|
|[Scenario 1: Online Activation](scenario-online-activation-vamt.md) |Describes how to distribute Multiple Activation Keys (MAKs) to products installed on one or more connected computers within a network. Additionally, it also describes how to instruct these products to contact Microsoft over the Internet for activation. |
|[Scenario 2: Proxy Activation](scenario-proxy-activation-vamt.md) |Describes how to use two VAMT host computers—the first one with Internet access and a second computer within an isolated workgroup—as proxies to perform MAK volume activation for workgroup computers that don't have Internet access. |
|[Scenario 3: Key Management Service (KMS) Client Activation](scenario-kms-activation-vamt.md) |Describes how to use VAMT to configure client products for Key Management Service (KMS) activation. By default, volume license editions of currently supported versions of Windows and Microsoft Office use KMS for activation. |
