## Documentation feedback

Select the **Feedback** link in the upper right of any article to go to the Feedback section at the bottom. Feedback is integrated with GitHub Issues. For more information about this integration with GitHub Issues, see the [docs platform blog post](/teamblog/a-new-feedback-system-is-coming-to-docs).

To share docs feedback about the current article, select **This page**. A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) is a prerequisite for providing documentation feedback. Once you sign in, there's a one-time authorization for the MicrosoftDocs organization. It then opens the GitHub new issue form. Add a descriptive title and detailed feedback in the body, but don't modify the document details section. Then select **Submit new issue** to file a new issue for the target article in the [Windows-ITPro-docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/issues).

To see whether there's already feedback for this article, select **View all page feedback**. This action opens a GitHub issue query for this article. By default it displays both open and closed issues. Review any existing feedback before you submit a new issue. If you find a related issue, select the face icon to add a reaction, add a comment to the thread, or **Subscribe** to receive notifications.

Use GitHub Issues to submit the following types of feedback:

- Doc bug: The content is out of date, unclear, confusing, or broken.
- Doc enhancement: A suggestion to improve the article.
- Doc question: You need help with finding existing documentation.
- Doc idea: A suggestion for a new article.
- Kudos: Positive feedback about a helpful or informative article.
- Localization: Feedback about content translation.
- Search engine optimization (SEO): Feedback about problems searching for content. Include the search engine, keywords, and target article in the comments.

If you create an issue for something not related to documentation, Microsoft will close the issue and redirect you to a better feedback channel. For example:

- [Product feedback](#give-product-feedback) for Update Compliance
- [Product questions (using Microsoft Q&A)](/answers/products/)
- [Support requests](#open-a-microsoft-support-case) for Update Compliance

To share feedback on the fundamental docs.microsoft.com platform, see [Docs feedback](https://aka.ms/sitefeedback). The platform includes all of the wrapper components such as the header, table of contents, and right menu. Also how the articles render in the browser, such as the font, alert boxes, and page anchors.
