# Use Update Compliance (preview)
<!--37063317, 30141258, 37063041-->
***(Applies to: Windows 11 & Windows 10)***

> [!Important]
> This information relates to a preview feature that's available for early testing and use in a production environment. This feature is fully supported but it's still in active development and may receive substantial changes until it becomes generally available.

In this article, you'll learn how to use Update Compliance to monitor Windows updates for your devices. To configure your environment for use with Update Compliance, see [Enable Update Compliance](update-compliance-v2-enable.md).

## Display Update Compliance data

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 
1. In the Azure portal, type **Log Analytics** in the search bar. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input.
1. Select **Log Analytics workspaces**.
1. Select the workspace that you use for Updates Compliance.
1. Select **Logs** under the **General** group in your workspace.
1. If the **Always show Queries** option is enabled in Log Analytics, close the query window to access the schema.
1. Under **Schemas and filter**, select **Group by: Solution** and then expand the **Update Compliance** schema. If the **Group by: Category** is selected, the **Update Compliance** schema is listed under the **Other** category.
1. Use the [Update Compliance schema](update-compliance-v2-schema.md) for [custom Kusto (KQL) queries](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/), to build [custom workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview), or to build your own solution to display the Update Compliance data. For example, you might query the data to review information for different types of alerts in the past 7 days and how many times each alert occurred.

```kusto
UCUpdateAlert
| summarize count=count() by AlertClassification, AlertSubtype, ErrorCode, Description
```

## Update Compliance data latency

Update Compliance uses Windows client diagnostic data as its data source. After you add Update Compliance and appropriately configure your devices, it could take 48-72 hours before they first appear.

The data powering Update Compliance is refreshed every 24 hours, and refreshes with the latest data from all of your organization's devices that have been seen in the past 28 days. The entire set of data is refreshed in each daily snapshot, which means that the same data can be ingested again even if no new data actually arrived from the device since the last snapshot. Snapshot time can be determined by the TimeGenerated field for each record, while LastScan can be used to roughly determine the freshness of each record's data. Device connectivity to the internet and generally how active the device is influences how long it will take before it appears in Update Compliance.

| Data Type | Data upload rate from device | Data Latency |
|--|--|--|
| UCClient | Once per day |4 hours |
| UCClientUpdateStatus|Every update event (Download, install, etc.)|24-36 hours |
| UCServiceUpdateStatus| Every update event (Download, install, etc.)|24-36 hours |
| UCUpdateAlert | Every event | 24-36 hours |
| UCDeviceAlert | Every event | 24-36 hours |
| UCClientReadinessStatus | After Windows 11 readiness assessment |24-36 hours |

## Using Log Analytics

Update Compliance is built on the Log Analytics platform that is integrated into Operations Management Suite. All data in the workspace is the direct result of a query. Understanding the tools and features at your disposal, all integrated within Azure portal, can deeply enhance your experience and complement Update Compliance.
