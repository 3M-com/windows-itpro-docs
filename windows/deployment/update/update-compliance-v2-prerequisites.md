# Update Compliance prerequisites
<!--37063317, 30141258, 37063041-->
***(Applies to: Windows 11 & Windows 10)***

> [!Important]
> - This information relates to a preview feature that's available for early testing and use in a production environment. This feature is fully supported but it's still in active development and may receive substantial changes until it becomes generally available.
> - Update Compliance is a Windows service hosted in Azure that uses Windows diagnostic data. You should be aware that Update Compliance doesn't meet [US Government community compliance (GCC)](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc#us-government-community-compliance) requirements. For a list of GCC offerings for Microsoft products and services, see the [Microsoft Trust Center](/compliance/regulatory/offering-home). Update Compliance is available in the Azure Commercial cloud, but not available for GCC High or United States Department of Defense customers.

## Update Compliance prerequisites

Before you begin the process to add Update Compliance to your Azure subscription, ensure you meet the prerequisites.

### Azure and Azure Active Directory

- An Azure subscription with [Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/)
- You must have either an Owner or Contributor [Azure role](/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles#azure-roles) as a minimum in order to add the Update Compliance solution.
- Devices must be Azure Active Directory joined and meet the below OS, diagnostic, and endpoint access requirements
  - Devices that are Workplace joined only (Azure AD registered) aren't supported with Update Compliance

### Operating systems and editions

- Windows 11 Professional, Education, Enterprise, and [Enterprise multi-session](/azure/virtual-desktop/windows-10-multisession-faq) editions
- Windows 10 Professional, Education, Enterprise, and [Enterprise multi-session](/azure/virtual-desktop/windows-10-multisession-faq) editions

Update Compliance only provides data for the standard Desktop Windows client version and isn't currently compatible with Windows Server, Surface Hub, IoT, or other versions.

### Windows client servicing channels

Update Compliance supports Windows client devices on the following channels:

- General Availability Channel
- Long-term Servicing Channel (LTSC).
- Update Compliance *counts* Windows Insider Preview devices, but doesn't currently provide detailed deployment insights for them.

### Diagnostic data requirements

At minimum, Update Compliance requires devices to send diagnostic data at *Required* level (previously *Basic*). Some queries in Update Compliance require devices to send diagnostic data at the following levels:

- *Optional* level (previously *Full*) for Windows 11 devices
- *Enhanced* level for Windows 10 devices

    > [!Note]
    > Device names don't appear in Update Compliance unless you individually opt-in devices by using policy. The configuration script does this for you, but when using other client configuration methods, set one of the following to display device names:
    > - CSP: System/[AllowDeviceNameInDiagnosticData](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-system#system-allowdevicenameindiagnosticdata)
    > - Group Policy: **Allow device name to be sent in Windows diagnostic data** under **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Data Collection and Preview Builds**

For more information about what's included in different diagnostic levels, see [Diagnostics, feedback, and privacy in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/diagnostics-feedback-and-privacy-in-windows-28808a2b-a31b-dd73-dcd3-4559a5199319).

### Data transmission requirements

<!--Using include for endpoint access requirements-->
[!INCLUDE [Endpoints for Update Compliance](./includes/update-compliance-endpoints.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Enrolling into Update Compliance from the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure) or enrolling programmatically another way currently isn't supported. You must manually add Update Compliance to your Azure subscription.

## Log Analytics prerequisites

### Permissions

- To edit and write queries, we recommend the [Log Analytics Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#log-analytics-contributor) role.

- To read and only view data, we recommend the [Log Analytics Reader](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#log-analytics-reader) role.
