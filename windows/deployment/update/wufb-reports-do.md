# Delivery Optimization data in Windows Update for Business reports
<!--7715481-->
***(Applies to: Windows 11 & Windows 10)***

[Delivery Optimization](../do/waas-delivery-optimization.md) (DO) is a Windows feature that can be used to reduce bandwidth consumption by sharing the work of downloading updates among multiple devices in your environment. You can use DO in conjunction with many other deployment methods, but it's a cloud-managed solution, and access to the DO cloud services is a requirement.

Windows Update for Business reports provides Delivery Optimization information in the following places:
- The Windows Update for Business reports [workbook](wufb-reports-workbook.md)
- [UCDOAggregatedStatus](wufb-reports-schema-ucdoaggregatedstatus.md)
- [UCDOStatus](wufb-reports-schema-ucdostatus.md)
