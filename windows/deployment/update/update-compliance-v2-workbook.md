<!-- MAX6325272, OS33771278 -->
***(Applies to: Windows 11 & Windows 10)***

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This information relates to a preview feature that's available for early testing and use in a production environment. This feature is fully supported but it's still in active development and may receive substantial changes until it becomes generally available.

[Update Compliance](update-compliance-v2-overview.md) presents information commonly needed by updates administrators in an easy to use format. Update Compliance uses [Azure Workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-getting-started) to give you a visual representation of your compliance data. The workbook is broken down into three tab sections:

- [Summary](#summary-tab)
- [Quality updates](#quality-updates-tab)
- [Feature updates](#feature-updates-tab)

## Open the Update Compliance workbook

To access the Update Compliance workbook:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Monitor** > **Workbooks** from the menu bar.
   - You can also type **Monitor** in the search bar. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input.

2. When the gallery opens, select the **Update Compliance** workbook. You can also filter workbooks by name in the gallery.
