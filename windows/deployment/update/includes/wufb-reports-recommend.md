<!--This file is shared by all Update Compliance v1 articles.  -->

> [!Important]
> Update Compliance no longer accepts new onboarding requests and new requests will fail. Instead, use [Windows Update for Business reports](..\wufb-reports-overview.md) to monitor compliance for updates. If you're currently using Update Compliance, you can continue to use it, but you can't change your `CommercialID`.
