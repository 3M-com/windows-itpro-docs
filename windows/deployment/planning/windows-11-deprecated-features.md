# Windows 11 features we’re no longer developing

> Applies to: Windows 11

Each version of Windows 11 adds new features and functionality; occasionally we also remove features and functionality, often because we've added a better option. Below are the details about the features and functionalities that are no longer being developed in Windows 11. For information about features that have been removed, see [Features we removed](windows-11-removed-features.md).

The features described below are no longer being actively developed, and might be removed in a future update. Some features have been replaced with other features or functionality and some are now available from other sources.

**The following list is subject to change and might not include every affected feature or functionality.**

> [!NOTE] 
> If you have feedback about the proposed replacement of any of these features, you can use the [Feedback Hub app](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app).
