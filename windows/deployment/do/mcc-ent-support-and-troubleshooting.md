<!--Using include file, get-azure-subscription.md, do/mcc-isp.md for shared content-->
[!INCLUDE [Get Azure subscription](includes/get-azure-subscription.md)]



TODO: List the prerequisites

<!-- 4. Task H2s ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Multiple procedures should be organized in H2 level sections. A section contains a major grouping of steps that help users complete a task. Each section is represented as an H2 in the article.

For portal-based procedures, minimize bullets and numbering.

* Each H2 should be a major step in the task.
* Phrase each H2 title as "<verb> * <noun>" to describe what they'll do in the step.
* Don't start with a gerund.
* Don't number the H2s.
* Begin each H2 with a brief explanation for context.
* Provide a ordered list of procedural steps.
* Provide a code block, diagram, or screenshot if appropriate
* An image, code block, or other graphical element comes after numbered step it illustrates.
* If necessary, optional groups of steps can be added into a section.
* If necessary, alternative groups of steps can be added into a section.

<!-- 5. Next step/Related content------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optional: You have two options for manually curated links in this pattern: Next step and Related content. You don't have to use either, but don't use both.
  - For Next step, provide one link to the next step in a sequence. Use the blue box format
  - For Related content provide 1-3 links. Include some context so the customer can determine why they would click the link. Add a context sentence for the following links.
