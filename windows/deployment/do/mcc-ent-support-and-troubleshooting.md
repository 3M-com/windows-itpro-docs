## Steps to obtain an Azure subscription ID

<!--Using include file, get-azure-subscription.md, do/mcc-isp.md for shared content-->
[!INCLUDE [Get Azure subscription](includes/get-azure-subscription.md)]


<<<<<<< HEAD

TODO: List the prerequisites

<!-- 4. Task H2s ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Multiple procedures should be organized in H2 level sections. A section contains a major grouping of steps that help users complete a task. Each section is represented as an H2 in the article.

For portal-based procedures, minimize bullets and numbering.

* Each H2 should be a major step in the task.
* Phrase each H2 title as "<verb> * <noun>" to describe what they'll do in the step.
* Don't start with a gerund.
* Don't number the H2s.
* Begin each H2 with a brief explanation for context.
* Provide a ordered list of procedural steps.
* Provide a code block, diagram, or screenshot if appropriate
* An image, code block, or other graphical element comes after numbered step it illustrates.
* If necessary, optional groups of steps can be added into a section.
* If necessary, alternative groups of steps can be added into a section.

-->

## "\<verb\> * \<noun\>"
=======
<!-- 1. H1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Use a "<verb> * <noun>" format for your H1. Pick an H1 that clearly conveys the task the user will complete.

For example: "Migrate data from regular tables to ledger tables" or "Create a new Azure SQL Database".

* Include only a single H1 in the article.
* Don't start with a gerund.
* Don't include "Tutorial" in the H1.

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: Lead with a light intro that describes, in customer-friendly language, what the customer will do. Answer the fundamental “why would I want to do this?” question. Keep it short.

Readers should have a clear idea of what they will do in this article after reading the introduction.

* Introduction immediately follows the H1 text.
* Introduction section should be between 1-3 paragraphs.
* Don't use a bulleted list of article H2 sections.

Example: In this article, you will migrate your user databases from IBM Db2 to SQL Server by using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Db2.

This article contains instructions on how to troubleshoot different issues you may encounter while using MCCE. These issues are categorized by the task in which they may be encountered. For example, this next section covers troubleshooting [MCC Azure resource creation](mcc-ent-create-resource-and-cache.md).

## Troubleshooting Azure resource creation

MCC Azure resource creation can be initiated using either the Azure portal or the Azure CLI command set. If you're encountering an error during resource creation, check that you have the necessary RPaaS permissions and have filled out all required fields.

<!-- 5. Next step/Related content------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optional: You have two options for manually curated links in this pattern: Next step and Related content. You don't have to use either, but don't use both.
  - For Next step, provide one link to the next step in a sequence. Use the blue box format
  - For Related content provide 1-3 links. Include some context so the customer can determine why they would click the link. Add a context sentence for the following links.
