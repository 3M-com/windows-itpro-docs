-->

<!-- 1. H1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example: "Migrate data from regular tables to ledger tables" or "Create a new Azure SQL Database".

* Include only a single H1 in the article.
* Don't start with a gerund.
* Don't include "Tutorial" in the H1.

# Troubleshoot Microsoft Connected Cache for Enterprise and Education (MCCE)

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: Lead with a light intro that describes, in customer-friendly language, what the customer will do. Answer the fundamental “why would I want to do this?” question. Keep it short.

Readers should have a clear idea of what they will do in this article after reading the introduction.

* Introduction immediately follows the H1 text.
* Introduction section should be between 1-3 paragraphs.
* Don't use a bulleted list of article H2 sections.

Example: In this article, you will migrate your user databases from IBM Db2 to SQL Server by using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Db2.

## Troubleshooting Azure resource creation

MCC Azure resource creation can be initiated using either the Azure portal or the Azure CLI command set. If you're encountering an error during resource creation, check that you have the necessary RPaaS permissions and have filled out all required fields.
