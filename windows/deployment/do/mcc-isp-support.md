## Sign up errors

#### Cannot verify account

During sign-up, we verify the information you provide against what is present in [Peering DB](https://www.peeringdb.com/). Make sure the information for your ISP entry on [Peering DB](https://www.peeringdb.com/) is up to date and matches what you provide during sign-up.

#### Invalid verification code

During sign-up, a verification code is sent to your NOC email address present in [Peering DB](https://www.peeringdb.com/). This code expires in 24 hours. If expired, you'll need to request a new verification code to complete sign up.  

## Cache Node Errors  

#### Cannot find my cache node
  
Did you previously had access to your cache nodes but it's now no longer accessible? If so, it may be because you had a trial subscription, and its trial period ended. To resolve this issue, complete the following two steps:

1. Create a new Azure Pay-As-You-Go subscription  
1. Recreate the cache nodes using the new subscription
