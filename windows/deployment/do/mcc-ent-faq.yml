      - question: How does Microsoft Connected Cache populate its content?
        answer: Microsoft Connected Cache is a cold cache warmed by client requests. The client requests content and that is what fills up the cache. There's no off-peak cache fill necessary. Microsoft Connected Cache will reach out to different CDN providers just like a client device would. The traffic flow from Microsoft Connected Cache will vary depending on how you currently transit to each of these CDN providers. The content can come from third party CDNs or from AFD.
      - question: Is it possible to not update the Microsoft Connected Cache software or delay update longer than the timeline provided in the updates configuration?
        answer: No. It is important to keep the Microsoft Connected Cache software up to date, especially when it comes to security issues. Microsoft has validated updates prior to releasing Microsoft releasing to Enterprises Connected Cache updates and will only release updates when it is necessary to keep customers secure or to ensure the continued successful operation of Connected Cache nodes for customers.
