# Microsoft Connected Cache for Enterprise and Education (MCCE) Private Preview

If you participated in the MCCE Private Preview, thank you for your collaboration and feedback.

If you would like to continue using MCCE, you will need to upgrade your cache nodes to the Public Preview release. Existing Private Preview cache nodes will continue to function but can no longer be managed or monitored remotely via the MCCE Azure service.

As such, we strongly recommend you [recreate your Private Preview cache nodes in Azure](mcc-ent-create-resource-and-cache.md) and then [redeploy the MCCE caching software to your host machines](mcc-ent-deploy-to-windows.md) using the latest OS-specific installer. You do not need to re-create your MCC Azure resource.

## Next step
