# Microsoft Connected Cache for Enterprise and Education (MCCE) Private Preview

If you participated in the MCCE early preview, thank you for your collaboration and feedback.

To continue using MCCE, we strongly recommend that you upgrade your existing cache nodes to the Public Preview release. Cache nodes created and deployed during early preview should still function but can no longer be managed or monitored remotely via the MCCE Azure service.

As such, we strongly recommend you [recreate your existing cache nodes in Azure](mcc-ent-create-resource-and-cache.md) and then [redeploy the MCCE caching software to your host machines](mcc-ent-deploy-to-windows.md) using the latest OS-specific installer. You don't need to re-create your MCC Azure resource.

## Next step
