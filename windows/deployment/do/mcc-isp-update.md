# Update your cache node

Microsoft will release updates for MCC periodically to improve performance, functionality, and security. Updates will not require any action from the customer. Instead, when an update is available, your cache node will automatically update during low traffic hours with minimal to no impact to your end customers. 

To view which version your cache nodes are currently on, navigate to the **Cache nodes** tab to view the versions in the list view.

To view update release notes, visit [Version History](mcc-version-history.md).
