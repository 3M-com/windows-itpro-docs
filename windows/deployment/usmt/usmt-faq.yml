title: Frequently Asked Questions
summary: |
  The following sections provide frequently asked questions and recommended solutions for migrations using User State Migration Tool (USMT).


sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: |
          How much space is needed on the destination computer?
        answer: |
          The destination computer needs enough available space for the following items:
          
          -   Operating system
          
          -   Applications
          
          -   Uncompressed store
          
      - question: |
          Can I store the files and settings directly on the destination computer or do I need a server?
        answer: |
          You don't need to save the files to a server. If you're moving the user state to a new computer, you can create the store on:

          - A shared folder.
          - On media that you can remove, such as a USB flash drive (UFD).
          - Directly on the destination computer.

          To store it directly on the destination computer:
          
          1.  Create and share the directory `C:\store` on the destination computer.
          
          1.  Run the **ScanState** tool on the source computer and save the files and settings to `\\<DestinationComputerName>\store`
          
          1.  Run the **LoadState** tool on the destination computer and specify `C:\store` as the store location.
          
      - question: |
          Can I migrate data between operating systems with different languages?
        answer: |
          No. USMT doesn't support migrating data between operating systems with different languages; the source computer's operating-system language must match the destination computer's operating-system language.

      - question: |
          Can I change the location of the temporary directory on the destination computer?
        answer: |
          Yes. The environment variable `USMT\_WORKING\_DIR` can be changed to an alternative temporary directory. There are some offline migration scenarios where changing the temporary directory is necessary, for example, when the USMT binaries are located on read-only Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE) boot media.

      - question: |
          How do I install USMT?
        answer: |
          Because USMT is included in Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK), you need to install the Windows ADK package on at least one computer in your environment. The USMT binaries can then be copied from the USMT directory located on the original computer where the Windows ADK was installed to additional client computers.

      - question: |
          How do I uninstall USMT?
        answer: |
          For computers that have the Windows ADK installed, uninstalling the Windows ADK from the computer uninstalls USMT. For client computers that don't have the Windows ADK installed, you can delete the USMT directory to uninstall USMT.

  - name: Files and Settings
    questions:
      - question: |
          How can I exclude a folder or a certain type of file from the migration?
        answer: |
          You can use the **\<unconditionalExclude\>** element to globally exclude data from the migration. For example, you can use this element to exclude all MP3 files on the computer or to exclude all files from `C:\UserData`. This element excludes objects regardless of any other **\<include\>** rules that are in the **.xml** files. For an example, see **\<unconditionalExclude\>** in the [Exclude files and settings](usmt-exclude-files-and-settings.md) article. For the syntax of this element, see [XML elements library](usmt-xml-elements-library.md).
          
      - question: |
          What happens to files that were located on a drive that don't exist on the destination computer?
        answer: |
          USMT migrates the files to the `%SystemDrive%` while maintaining the correct folder hierarchy. For example:

          - `E:\data\File.pst` is on the source computer.
          - Destination computer doesn't have an E:\\ drive.
          - C:\\ is the system drive on the destination computer.

          the file is migrated to `C:\data\File.pst`. This behavior holds true even when **\<locationModify\>** rules attempt to move data to a drive that doesn't exist on the destination computer.
          
  - name: USMT .xml Files
    questions:
      - question: |
          Where can I get examples of USMT **.xml** files?
        answer: |
          The following articles include examples of USMT **.xml** files:
          
          -   [Exclude files and settings](usmt-exclude-files-and-settings.md)
          
          -   [Reroute files and settings](usmt-reroute-files-and-settings.md)
          
          -   [Include files and settings](usmt-include-files-and-settings.md)
          
          -   [Custom XML examples](usmt-custom-xml-examples.md)
          
      - question: |
          Can I use custom **.xml** files that were written for USMT 5.0?
        answer: |
          Yes. You can use custom **.xml** files that were written for USMT 5.0 with newer versions of USMT. However, in order to use new USMT functionality, you must revisit your custom USMT files and refresh them to include the new command-line options and XML elements.

      - question: |
          How can I validate the **.xml** files?
        answer: |
          You can use the USMT XML Schema (`MigXML.xsd`) to write and validate migration **.xml** files.

      - question: |
          Why must I list the **.xml** files with both the `ScanState.exe` and `LoadState.exe` commands?
        answer: |
          The **.xml** files aren't copied to the store as in previous versions of USMT. Because the **ScanState** and **LoadState** tools need the **.xml** files to control the migration, you must specify the same set of **.xml** files for the `ScanState.exe` and `LoadState.exe` commands. If you used a particular set of mig\*.xml files in the **ScanState** tool, either called through the `/auto` option, or individually through the `/i` option, then you should use same option to call the exact same mig\*.xml files in the **LoadState** tool. However, the `Config.xml` file doesn't need to be specified, unless files and settings that were migrated to the store need to be excluded. For example, you might want to migrate the **Documents** folder to the store, but not to the destination computer. To do this type of migration, modify the `Config.xml` file and specify the updated file with the `LoadState.exe` command. **LoadState** migrates only the files and settings that you want to migrate.
          
          If you exclude an **.xml** file from the `LoadState.exe` command, then all of the data that is in the store that was migrated with the missing **.xml** files are migrated. However, the migration rules that were specified for the `ScanState.exe` command don't apply. For example, if you exclude a `MigApp.xml` file that has a rerouting rule such as `MigsysHelperFunction.RelativeMove("c:\data", "%CSIDL_PERSONAL%")`, USMT doesn't reroute the files. Instead, it migrates them to `C:\data`.
          
      - question: |
          Which files can I modify and specify on the command line?
        answer: |
          You can specify the `MigUser.xml` and `MigApp.xml` files on the command line. You can modify each of these files. Manifests control the migration of operating system settings. Manifests can't be modified. If you want to exclude certain operating-system settings or any other components, create and modify the `Config.xml` file.

      - question: |
          What happens if I don't specify the **.xml** files on the command line?
        answer: |
          -   **ScanState**
          
              If you don't specify any files with the `ScanState.exe` command, all user accounts and default operating system components are migrated.
          
          -   **LoadState**
          
              If you don't specify any files with the `LoadState.exe` command, all data that is in the store is migrated. However, any target-specific migration rules that were specified in **.xml** files with the `ScanState.exe` command doesn't apply. For example, if you exclude a `MigApp.xml` file that has a rerouting rule such as `MigsysHelperFunction.RelativeMove("c:\data", "%CSIDL_PERSONAL%")`, USMT doesn't reroute the files. Instead, it migrates them to `C:\data`.
          
  - name: Conflicts and Precedence
    questions:
      - question: |
          What happens when there are conflicting XML rules or conflicting objects on the destination computer?
        answer: |
          For more information, see [Conflicts and precedence](usmt-conflicts-and-precedence.md).
