# User State Migration Tool (USMT) Overview Topics
The User State Migration Tool (USMT) 10.0 provides a highly customizable user-profile migration experience for IT professionals. USMT includes three command-line tools: ScanState.exe, LoadState.exe, and UsmtUtils.exe. USMT also includes a set of three modifiable .xml files: MigApp.xml, MigDocs.xml, and MigUser.xml. Additionally, you can create custom .xml files to support your migration needs. You can also create a Config.xml file to specify files or settings to exclude from the migration.
