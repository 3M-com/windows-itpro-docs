# Choose a Migration Store Type

One of the main considerations for planning your migration is to determine which migration store type best meets your needs. As part of these considerations, determine how much space is required to run the User State Migration Tool (USMT) 10.0 components on your source and destination computers, and how much space is needed to create and host the migration store, whether you're using a local share, network share, or storage device. The final consideration is ensuring that user date integrity is maintained by encrypting the migration store.
