# Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise

## Service level objective

Windows Autopatch aims to keep at least 90% of eligible devices on a [supported version](/deployoffice/overview-update-channels#support-duration-for-monthly-enterprise-channel) of the Monthly Enterprise Channel (MEC) for [Enterprise Standard Suite](/deployoffice/about-microsoft-365-apps) (Access, Excel, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word). Microsoft 365 Apps deployed on the [Monthly Enterprise Channel](/deployoffice/overview-update-channels#monthly-enterprise-channel-overview) are supported for two months.

> [!NOTE]
> [Microsoft Teams](../operate/windows-autopatch-teams.md) uses a different update channel from the rest of Microsoft 365 Apps.

## Device eligibility

For a device to be eligible for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise updates, as a part of Windows Autopatch, they must meet the following criteria:  

- Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise 64-bit must be installed.
- There are no policy conflicts between Microsoft Autopatch policies and customer policies.
- The device must have checked into the Intune service in the last five days.

## Update release schedule

All devices registered for Windows Autopatch will receive updates from the [Monthly Enterprise Channel](/deployoffice/overview-update-channels#monthly-enterprise-channel-overview). This practice provides your users with new features each month, and they'll receive just one update per month on a predictable release schedule. Updates are released on the second Tuesday of the month; these updates can include feature, security, and quality updates. These updates occur automatically and are pulled directly from the Office Content Delivery Network (CDN).

Unlike Windows update, the Office CDN doesn't make the update available to all devices at once. Over the course of the release, the Office CDN gradually makes the update available to the whole population of devices. Windows Autopatch doesn't control the order in which updates are offered to devices across your estate. After the update has been downloaded, there's a three-day [update deadline](/deployoffice/configure-update-settings-microsoft-365-apps) that specifies how long the user has until the user must apply the update.  

## Update rings

Since the Office CDN determines when devices are offered updates, Windows Autopatch doesn't use rings to control the rollout of these updates.

## End user experience

There are two parts of the end user experience that are configured by Windows Autopatch:

- Behavior during updates
- Office client

### Behavior during updates

Updates can only be applied when Microsoft 365 Apps aren't running. Therefore, notifications usually appear because the user is working in a Microsoft 365 App, such as Microsoft Outlook, and hasn't closed it in several days.

Once the device has downloaded the update, users are given notifications leading up to the deadline. They'll receive the following message in the notification area in Windows, reminding them that updates are ready to be applied.

*Updates ready to be applied
Updates are required by your system admin are blocked by one or more apps. Office will restart at mm/dd/yyyy h:mm AM/PM to apply updates.*

Alternatively, users can select **Update now** to apply the updates. The user is then prompted to close all open Office programs. After the updates are applied, the message disappears.

If the deadline arrives and the updates still aren't applied, users see a dialog box that warns them that they have 15 minutes before the updates are applied.

This warning gives users 15 minutes to save and close any work. When the countdown reaches 00âˆ¶00, any open Office programs are closed, and the updates are applied.

### Office client app configuration

To ensure that users are receiving automatic updates, Windows Autopatch prevents the user from opting out of automatic updates.  

## Update controls

If Windows Autopatch detects issues between versions of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, we might pause the update by forcing Microsoft 365 Apps to stay on a specific version.  

Windows Autopatch will either:

- Choose to stay on the previous version for rings that haven't received the update yet.
- Force all devices to roll back to the previous version.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Autopatch doesn't currently allow customers to force their devices to stay on a previous version or rollback to a previous version.

Since quality updates are bundled together into a single release in the [Monthly Enterprise Channel](/deployoffice/overview-update-channels#monthly-enterprise-channel-overview), we can't roll back only a portion of the update for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.  

## Conflicting and unsupported policies

Deploying any of the following policies to a managed device will make that device ineligible for management since the device will prevent us from delivering the service as designed.

### Update policies

Window Autopatch deploys mobile device management (MDM) policies to configure Microsoft 365 Apps and requires a specific configuration. If any [Microsoft 365 Apps update settings](/deployoffice/configure-update-settings-microsoft-365-apps) are deployed which conflict with our policies, then the device won't be eligible for management.

| Update setting | Value | Usage reason |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Set updates to occur automatically | Enabled | Enable automatic updates |
| Specify a location to look for updates | Blank | Don't use this setting since it overwrites the update branch |
| Update branch | Monthly Enterprise | Supported branch for Windows Autopatch |
| Specify the version of Microsoft 365 Apps to update to | Variable | Used to roll back to a previous version if an error occurs |
| Set a deadline by when updates must be applied | 3 | Update deadline |
| Hide update notifications from users | Turned off | Users should be notified when Microsoft 365 Apps are being updated |
| Hide the option to turn on or off automatic Office updates | Turned on | Prevents users from disabling automatic updates |

## Microsoft 365 Apps servicing profiles

A service profile takes precedence over other management tools, such as Microsoft Endpoint Manager or the Office Deployment Tool. This means that the servicing profile will affect all devices that meet the above requirements regardless of existing management tools in your environment. So, if you're targeting a managed device with a servicing profile it will be ineligible for Microsoft 365 App update management.

## Incidents and outages

If devices in your tenant aren't meeting the [service level objective](#service-level-objective) for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise updates, an incident will be raised. The Windows Autopatch Service Engineering Team will work to bring the devices back into compliance.

If you're experiencing issues related to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise updates, [submit a support request](../operate/windows-autopatch-support-request.md).
