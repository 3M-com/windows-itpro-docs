## Introduction

Windows Sun Valley is a newly designed Windows client operating system due to be released later in 2021. It is fresh and light, yet familiar to those who use Windows today. Windows Sun Valley is designed to support today's flexible [hybrid work](https://pulse.microsoft.com/the-journey-to-the-new-normal-driving-innovation-and-productivity-in-a-hybrid-world/) environment. The goal of this release is to be the most reliable, secure, connected, and performant OS release ever. 

Windows Sun Valley is built on the same foundation as Windows 10, so you can generally deploy, manage, and secure Sun Valley using the same tools and solutions you use today. 

All upgrades to Windows Sun Valley from Windows 10 will be free. 

## How to get Windows Sun Valley

Windows Sun Valley will delivered as an upgrade to devices running Windows 10 beginning in the first half of 2022. Windows Sun Valley will also be available on new devices that meet the hardware requirements. 

You must be running Windows 10, version 20H1 or later, and meet the minimum hardware specifications to be eligible to upgrade. For more information, see [Windows Sun Valley requirements](windows-sv-requirements.md).

For managed PCs that meet requirements, the upgrade will be provided using the same process that you use today for feature updates. For unmanaged PCs that meet requirements, the upgrade will be offered through Windows Update.

You can get early access to test Windows Sun Valley by joining the [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com), or by enabling pre-release Windows 10 feature updates in Configuration Manager or Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).

### Licensing

There are no unique licensing requirements for Windows Sun Valley beyond what is required for Windows 10 devices.

Microsoft 365 licenses that include Windows licenses will permit you to run Windows Sun Valley on supported devices.

If you have a volume license, it will equally cover Windows Sun Valley and Windows 10 devices before and after upgrade.

### Rollback

After you have upgraded to Windows Sun Valley, you have 10 days to use the rollback function if you wish to move back to Windows 10 while keeping your files and data. After the 10 day grace period, you will need to back up your data and perform a clean install to move back to Windows 10.

## Compatibility

Windows Sun Valley is based on the same foundation as Windows 10. Therefore, it supports investments that IT organizations have made to support Windows 10. 

### Management and tools

You can use your current management tools, processes, and settings to manage quality updates for both Windows 10 and Windows Sun Valley. For more information, see [Management tools](windows-sv-prepare.md#management-tools) and [Configurations](windows-sv-plan.md#configurations).

### Hardware compatibility

Most accessories and associated software that worked with Windows 10 are expected to work with Windows Sun Valley. Check with your accessory manufacturer for specific details.

### Application compatibility

Windows Sun Valley preserves the application compatibility promise made with Windows 10, and does not require changes to existing support processes or tooling to sustain the currency of applications and devices. Programs like App Assure and FastTrack for Microsoft M365 customers will continue to be available to support IT efforts to adopt and maintain Windows Sun Valley.


## Windows Sun Valley servicing

For details about the Windows Sun Valley servicing cadence and lifecycle, see [Windows Sun Valley servicing](sv-plan.md#servicing).

## Windows 10 lifecycle

For organizations who cannot move to Windows Sun Valley immediately, Microsoft’s guidance is to standardize devices on Windows 10, version 21H2. This release will be the last feature update to Windows 10, but will receive specific feature enhancements to ease migrating to Windows Sun Valley. 

Windows 10 will continue to be supported with security updates until October 2025.
