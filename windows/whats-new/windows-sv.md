It offers many innovations focused on enhancing end user productivity in a fresh experience that is flexible and fluid. Windows Sun Valley is designed to support today's hybrid work environment, and intended to be the most reliable, secure, connected, and performant Windows OS ever. 

This release is built on the same foundation as Windows 10, so the investments you have made in tools for update and device management are carried forward. Windows Sun Valley also sustains the application compatibility promise we made with Windows 10.

## How to get Windows Sun Valley

Windows Sun Valley will be delivered as an upgrade to eligible devices running Windows 10 beginning in the first half of 2022. Windows Sun Valley will also be available on new, eligible devices.

For PCs that are managed by your organization and meet the eligibility requirements, Windows Sun Valley will be available through the same channels that you use for Windows 10 feature updates today. Existing deployment and management tools such as Windows Update for Business, Microsoft Endpoint Management, and Windows Autopilot can be used to deploy and manage Windows Sun Valley. Commercial organizations running Pro, Enterprise and Education editions of Windows 10 will have control over when to upgrade their devices from Windows 10 to Windows Sun Valley.

For personal devices and other unmanaged PCs that meet the eligibility requirements, the Windows Sun Valley upgrade will be offered through Windows Update using Microsoft's [intelligent rollout](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/using-machine-learning-to-improve-the-windows-10-update/ba-p/877860) process.
