## Introduction

Windows Sun Valley is the next evolution of Windows; the most significant update to the Windows operating system since Windows 10. It offers many innovations focused on enhancing end user productivity in a fresh experience that is flexible and fluid. Windows Sun Valley is designed to support today's hybrid work environment, and intended to be the most reliable, secure, connected, and performant Windows operating system ever. 

This release is built on the same foundation as Windows 10, so the investments you have made in tools for update and device management are carried forward. Windows Sun Valley also sustains the application compatibility promise made with Windows 10, supplemented by programs like App Assure. For Microsoft 365 customers seeking further assistance, FastTrack will continue to be available to support your efforts to adopt Windows Sun Valley.

## How to get Windows Sun Valley

Windows Sun Valley will be delivered as an upgrade to eligible devices running Windows 10, beginning later in the 2021 calendar year. Windows Sun Valley will also be available on eligible new devices.

For administrators managing devices on behalf of their organization, Windows Sun Valley will be available through the same, familiar channels that you utilize today for Windows 10 feature updates. You will be able to use existing deployment and management tools, such as Windows Update for Business, Microsoft Endpoint Management, and Windows Autopilot. For more information, see [Plan for Windows Sun Valley](windows-sv-plan.md).

For eligible PCs that are not managed by an organization, the Windows Sun Valley upgrade will be offered through Windows Update using Microsoft's intelligent rollout process to ensure a smooth upgrade experience. Windows Sun Valley will initially be offered to Windows 10 devices purchased after June 2021 that meet or exceed the minimum hardware requirements. 

For more information about device eligibility, see [Windows Sun Valley requirements](windows-sv-requirements.md).

For those interested in testing Windows Sun Valley before general availability, you can join the [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com) or [Windows Insider Program for Business](https://insider.windows.com/for-business). You can also preview Windows Sun Valley by enabling pre-release Windows 10 feature updates in [Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/core/servers/manage/pre-release-features) or [Windows Server Update Services](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/publishing-pre-release-windows-10-feature-updates-to-wsus/ba-p/845054) (WSUS).

## Before you begin

Many organizations will have a mixed environment of Windows Sun Valley and Windows 10 devices. The following is a quick summary of licensing, compatibility, management, and servicing considerations.  

#### Licensing

There are no unique licensing requirements for Windows Sun Valley beyond what is required for Windows 10 devices.

Microsoft 365 licenses that include Windows 10 licenses will permit you to run Windows Sun Valley on supported devices. If you have a volume license, it will equally cover Windows Sun Valley and Windows 10 devices before and after upgrade.

#### Compatibility

Most accessories and associated drivers that work with Windows 10 are expected to work with Windows Sun Valley. Check with your accessory manufacturer for specific details.

Windows Sun Valley preserves the application compatibility promise made with Windows 10 and does not require changes to existing support processes or tooling to sustain the currency of applications and devices. Microsoft 365 customers can continue to use programs such as App Assure and FastTrack to support IT efforts to adopt and maintain Windows Sun Valley. For more information, see [Application compatibility](windows-sv-plan.md#application-compatibility).

#### Familiar processes

Windows Sun Valley is built on the same foundation as Windows 10, so generally you can use the same tools and solutions you use today to deploy, manage, and secure Windows Sun Valley. Your current management tools and processes will work to manage monthly quality updates for both Windows 10 and Windows Sun Valley. If you use non-Microsoft tools, check with your vendor to verify compatibility. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check with the providers of any non-Microsoft security and management solutions that you use to ensure compatibility with Windows Sun Valley, particularly those providing security or data loss prevention capabilities.  

For more information, see [Prepare for Windows Sun Valley](windows-sv-prepare.md).

#### Servicing Windows Sun Valley

Like Windows 10, Windows Sun Valley will receive monthly quality updates. However, it will have an annual feature update cadence. When Windows Sun Valley reaches general availability, important servicing-related announcements and information about known issues and safeguard holds can be found on the Windows release health hub. Monthly release notes will available via a consolidated Windows SV update history page at that time as well.
