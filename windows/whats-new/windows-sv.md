## Introduction

Windows Sun Valley is the next evolution of Windows; the most significant update to the Windows operating system since Windows 10. It offers a fresh experience that is flexible and fluid, designed to support today's hybrid work environment and to be the most reliable, secure, connected, and performant Windows OS ever. 

Windows Sun Valley contains many innovations focused on enhancing end user productivity. It is built on the same foundation as Windows 10, ensuring that the investments you have made in tools for update and device management are carried forward. Windows Sun Valley provides the benefits that commercial organizations and IT pros need and rely upon every day: best-in-class security, simplified manageability, and high availability. It also sustains the application compatibility promise we made with Windows 10, supplemented by programs like App Assure in cases where additional support is needed. 

In summary, because Windows Sun Valley is built on the same foundation as Windows 10, you can deploy, manage, and secure Windows SV using the same tools and solutions you use today. For Microsoft 365 customers seeking further assistance, FastTrack will continue to be available to support your efforts to adopt Windows SV.

## How to get Windows Sun Valley

Windows Sun Valley will be delivered as an upgrade to eligible devices running Windows 10 beginning in the first half of 2022. Windows Sun Valley will also be available on new, eligible devices.

For PCs that are managed by your organization and meet the eligibility requirements, Windows Sun Valley will be available through the same, familiar channels we utilize for Windows 10 feature updates today. You will be able to use existing deployment and management toolsets, such as Windows Update for Business, Microsoft Endpoint Management, and Windows Autopilot and those commercial customers running Pro, Enterprise and Education editions of Windows 10 will have control over when to upgrade their devices from Windows 10 to Windows Sun Valley. For more information, see Management tools.

For personal devices and other unmanaged PCs that meet the eligibility requirements, the upgrade will be offered through Windows Update using our intelligent rollout process to ensure a smooth upgrade experience. Windows 10 devices purchased after June 2021 that meet or exceed the minimum hardware requirements for Windows Sun Valley will be offered the upgrade starting in October of 2021.

For those interested in testing Windows Sun Valley before general availability, we recommend joining the Windows Insider Program or Windows Insider Program for Business [Release Preview Channel](/windows-insider/business/validate-Release-Preview-Channel), or enabling pre-release Windows 10 feature updates in [Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/core/servers/manage/pre-release-features) or [Windows Server Update Services](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/publishing-pre-release-windows-10-feature-updates-to-wsus/ba-p/845054) (WSUS).

For more information about eligibility to upgrade, see [Windows Sun Valley requirements](windows-sv-requirements.md).
