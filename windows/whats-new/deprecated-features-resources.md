## Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool

The [Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT)](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/msdt) gathers diagnostic data for analysis by support professionals. MSDT is the engine used to run legacy Windows built-in troubleshooters. Some of the built-in troubleshooters have already been [redirected](#redirected-troubleshooters) to the Get Help platform, while others will be [retired].  

 MSDT also allowed you to run [custom troubleshooting packages](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wintt/package-schema).
