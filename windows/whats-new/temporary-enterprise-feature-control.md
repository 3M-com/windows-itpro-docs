# Temporary enterprise feature control in Windows 11
<!--7790977-->
New features and enhancements are introduced through the monthly cumulative update to provide continuous innovation for Windows 11. To give organizations time to plan and prepare, some of these new features might be:

- Temporarily turned off by default using [temporary enterprise feature control](#temporary-enterprise-feature-control)
- Controlled by a policy that allows for [permanent enterprise feature control](#permanent-enterprise-feature-control)

Features that are turned off by default are listed in the KB article for the monthly cumulative update. Typically, a feature is selected to be off by default because it either impacts the user experience or IT administrators significantly. For example, a feature might be turned off by default if it requires a change in user behavior or if it requires IT administrators to take action before the feature can be used.
