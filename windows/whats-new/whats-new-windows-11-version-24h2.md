# What's new in Windows 11, version 24H2
<!--8631988-->
Windows 11, version 24H2 is a feature update for Windows 11. It includes all features and fixes in previous cumulative updates to Windows 11, version 23H2. This article lists the new and updated features IT Pros should know.

Windows 11, version 24H2 follows the [Windows 11 servicing timeline](/lifecycle/faq/windows#windows-11):

- **Windows 11 Pro**: Serviced for 24 months from the release date.
- **Windows 11 Enterprise**: Serviced for 36 months from the release date.

Devices updating from Windows 11, version 23H2 use an enablement package. Most the files for the 24H2 update already exist on Windows 11, version 23H2 devices that have installed a recent monthly security update. Many of the new features have already been enabled on Windows 11, version 23H2 clients. <!-- However, some features are just in an inactive and dormant state because they are under [temporary enterprise feature control](temporary-enterprise-feature-control.md). These new features remain dormant until they're turned on through the enablement package, a small, quick-to-install switch that activates all of the Windows 11, version 24H2 features. -->

Windows 11, version 24H2 is available through Windows Server Update Services (including Configuration Manager), Windows Update for Business, and the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC). For more information, see [PLACEHOLDER- How to get the Windows 11, version 24H2 update](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=178531). Review the [PLACEHOLDER- Windows 11, version 24H2 Windows IT Pro blog post](https://aka.ms/new-in-24H2) to discover information about available deployment resources such as the [Windows Deployment Kit (Windows ADK)](/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install).


To learn more about the status of the update rollout, known issues, and new information, see [Windows release health](/windows/release-health/).

## Features no longer under temporary enterprise control

[Temporary enterprise feature control](temporary-enterprise-feature-control.md) temporarily turns off certain features that were introduced during monthly cumulative updates for managed Windows 11, version 23H2 devices. For the purposes of temporary enterprise control, a system is considered managed if it's configured to get updates from Windows Update for Business or [Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)](/windows-server/administration/windows-server-update-services/get-started/windows-server-update-services-wsus). Clients that get updates from Microsoft Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune are considered managed since their updates ultimately come from WSUS or Windows Updates for Business.

When a managed Windows 11, version 23H2 device installs [version 24H2](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/5027397), the following features will no longer be under temporary enterprise feature control:

| Feature | KB article where the feature was introduced | 
|---|---|
| PLACEHOLDER Touch-optimized taskbar for 2-in-1 devices  | [February 28, 2023 - KB5022913](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/5022913)  |

## Checkpoint cumulative updates
<!--8769182--> 
Microsoft is introducing a new servicing model for Windows called checkpoint cumulative updates. Devices running Windows 11, version 24H2 or later, will use checkpoint cumulative updates. Previously, the cumulative updates contained all changes to the binaries since the last release to manufacturing (RTM) version. The size of the cumulative updates could grow large over time since RTM was used as the baseline for each update.

With checkpoint cumulative updates, the update file level differentials are based on a previous cumulative update instead of the RTM release. Cumulative updates that serve as a checkpoint will be released periodically. Using a checkpoint rather than RTM means the subsequent update packages are smaller, which makes downloads and installations faster. Using a checkpoint also means that in order for a device to install the latest cumulative update, the installation of a prerequisite cumulative update might be required. For more information about checkpoint cumulative updates, see [https://aka.ms/CheckpointCumulativeUpdates](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/introducing-windows-11-checkpoint-cumulative-updates/ba-p/4182552).


## Features added to Windows 11 since version 23H2

New features and enhancements were introduced to Windows 11, version 23H2 periodically to provide continuous innovation for Windows 11. These features and enhancements use the normal update servicing channels you're already familiar with. At first, new features are introduced with an optional nonsecurity preview release and gradually rolled out to clients. These new features are released later as part of a monthly security update release. For more information about continuous innovation, see [Update release cycle for Windows clients](/windows/deployment/update/release-cycle#continuous-innovation-for-windows-11) 

Some of the features were released within the past year's continuous innovation updates and carry forward into the 24H2 annual feature update include:

In addition to the monthly cumulative update, optional updates are available to provide new features and nonsecurity changes. Most optional updates are released on the fourth Tuesday of the month, known as optional nonsecurity preview releases. Optional updates can also include features that are gradually rolled out, known as controlled feature rollouts (CFRs). Installation of optional updates isn't enabled by default for devices that receive updates using Windows Update for Business. However, you can enable optional updates for devices by using the **Enable optional updates** policy. For more information about optional content, see [Enable optional updates](/windows/deployment/update/waas-configure-wufb#enable-optional-updates).

For more information about Wi-Fi 7, see the [Wi-Fi Alliance announcement](https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/wi-fi-7).

## Bluetooth &#174; Low Energy Audio support
