# What is Copilot in Windows?

>**Looking for consumer information?** See [Welcome to Copilot in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/welcome-to-copilot-in-windows-675708af-8c16-4675-afeb-85a5a476ccb0).

Copilot in Windows provides centralized generative AI assistance to your users right from the Windows desktop. Copilot in Windows appears as a side bar on the Windows desktop, docked to the right. It's designed to be an assistant that can help your users get things done in Windows. Copilot in Windows is a bit different from [Bing Chat in the Microsoft Edge sidebar](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/features/bing-chat), which provides assistance in the browser, since it can also perform actions such as changing Windows settings or performing common tasks in Windows. However, both user experiences, Copilot in Windows and Bing Chat in the Microsoft Edge sidebar, can share the same underlying chat provider platform. It's important for organizations to properly configure the chat provider platform that Copilot in Windows uses, since users can possibly pass sensitive information into the chat provider.


## Chat provider platforms for Copilot in Windows

Copilot in Windows uses one of the following chat provider platforms, dependant on your organization's configuration:

- [Bing Chat Enterprise](/bing-chat-enterprise/overview), which is intended for business use scenarios
    - Bing chat enterprise is available, at no additional cost, for customers who are licensed for Microsoft 365 E3 or E5, A3 or A5 for faculty, Business Standard, or Business Premium.
    - With Bing Chat Enterprise, user and organizational data is protected, chat data isn't saved, Microsoft has no eyes-on access, and your data isn't used to train the underlying large language models. Because of this protection, chat history, 3rd-party plugins, and the Bing mobile app for iOS or Android aren't currently supported.
- [Bing Chat](https://www.microsoft.com/bing/do-more-with-ai/what-is-bing-chat-and-how-can-you-use-it), which is intended for consumer use scenarios

### Enable Copilot in Windows for Windows 11, version 22H2 clients

Clients that get updates from Microsoft Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune are considered managed since their updates ultimately come from WSUS or Windows Updates for Business. 

To enable Copilot in Windows for managed Windows 11, version 22H2 devices, use the following instructions:

**GPOs/CSPs to set**
