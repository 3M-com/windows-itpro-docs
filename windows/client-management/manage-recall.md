# Manage Recall
<!--8908044-->
>**Looking for consumer information?** See [Retrace your steps with Recall](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/retrace-your-steps-with-recall-aa03f8a0-a78b-4b3e-b0a1-2eb8ac48701c).

Recall (preview) allows users to search locally saved and locally analyzed snapshots of their screen using natural language. By default, Recall is removed from commercially managed devices except for devices running Windows Home edition. IT admins, on their own, can't enable Recall for users. Recall is an opt-in experience that requires user consent to save snapshots. Users can choose to enable or disable Recall at any time. IT admins can only give users the option to enable snapshots and configure certain policies for Recall. This article provides information about Recall and how to manage it in a commercial environment.

> [!NOTE]
> - Recall is coming soon through a post-launch Windows update. See [aka.ms/copilotpluspcs](https://aka.ms/copilotpluspcs). 
>    - For Copilot+ PCs that are running Windows Insiders, Recall (preview) is now available. For more information, see [**Placeholder WIP Blog link**>](https://aka.ms/windowsinsiders).
> - Recall is optimized for select languages English, Chinese (simplified), French, German, Japanese, and Spanish. Content-based and storage limitations apply. For more information, see https://aka.ms/nextgenaipcs.

## What is Recall?

Recall (preview) allows you to search across time to find the content you need. Just describe how you remember it, and Recall retrieves the moment you saw it. Snapshots are taken periodically while content on the screen is different from the previous snapshot. The snapshots of your screen are organized into a timeline. Snapshots are locally stored and locally analyzed on your PC. Recall's analysis allows you to search for content, including both images and text, using natural language. 

When Recall opens a snapshot you selected, it enables Click to Do, which runs on top of the saved snapshot. Click to Do analyzes what's in the snapshot and allows you to interact with individual elements in the snapshot. For instance, you can copy text from the snapshot or send pictures from the snapshot to an app that supports `jpeg` files.

### Recall security and privacy architecture

We built privacy and security into Recall's design from the ground up. With Copilot+ PCs, you get powerful AI that runs locally on the device. No internet or cloud connections are required or used to save and analyze snapshots. Snapshots aren't sent to Microsoft. Recall AI processing occurs locally, and snapshots are securely stored on the local device only.

Recall doesn't share snapshots with other users that are signed into Windows on the same device. Microsoft can't access or view the snapshots. Recall requires users to confirm their identity with [Windows Hello](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/configure-windows-hello-dae28983-8242-bb2a-d3d1-87c9d265a5f0) before it launches and before accessing snapshots. At least one biometric sign-in option must be enabled for Windows Hello, either facial recognition or a fingerprint, to launch and use Recall. Before snapshots start getting saved the device, users need to open Recall and authenticate. Recall takes advantage of just in time decryption protected by Windows [Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS)](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/windows-hello-enhanced-sign-in-security). Snapshots and any associated information in the vector database are always encrypted. Encryption keys are protected via Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is tied to the user's Windows Hello ESS identity, and can be used by operations within a secure environment called a [Virtualization-based Security Enclave (VBS Enclave)](/windows/win32/trusted-execution/vbs-enclaves). This means that other users can't access these keys and thus can't decrypt this information. Device Encryption or BitLocker are enabled by default on Windows 11. For more information, see [Recall security and privacy architecture in the Windows Experience Blog](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=179096).

In keeping with Microsoft's commitment to data privacy and security, all captured images and processed data are kept on the device and processed locally. However, Click to Do allows users to choose if they want to perform additional actions on their content. 

Click to Do allows users to choose to get more information about their selected content online. When users choose one of the following Click to Do actions, the selected content is sent to the online provider from the local device to complete the request:
-	**Search the web**: Sends the selected content to the default search engine of the default browser
-	**Open website**: Opens the selected website in the default browser
-	**Visual search with Bing**: Sends the selected content to Bing visual search using the default browser. 

When users choose to send content from Click to Do to an app, like Paint, Click to Do will temporarily save the selected content in order to complete the transfer. Click to Do creates a temporary file in one of the following locations: 
- `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Temp` 
- `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Packages\MicrosoftWindows.Client.AIX_cw5n1h2txyewy\TempState`

The temporary file is deleted once the app is finished with the content.

## System requirements

Recall has the following minimum requirements:

- A [Copilot+ PC](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/business/devices/copilot-plus-pcs#copilot-plus-pcs)
- 16 GB RAM
- 8 logical processors
- 256 GB storage capacity
  - To enable Recall, you need at least 50 GB of space free
  - Snapshot capture automatically pauses once the device has less than 25 GB of disk space
- Users need to enroll into [Windows Hello](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/) with at least one biometric sign-in option enabled in order to authenticate.

## Supported browsers

Users need a supported browser for Recall to [filter websites](#user-controlled-settings-for-recall) and to automatically filter private browsing activity. Supported browsers, and their capabilities include:

- **Microsoft Edge**: blocks websites and filters private browsing activity
- **Firefox**: blocks websites and filters private browsing activity
- **Opera**: blocks websites and filters private browsing activity
- **Google Chrome**: blocks websites and filters private browsing activity
- **Chromium based browsers** (124 or later): For Chromium-based browsers not listed, filters private browsing activity only, doesn't block specific websites


## Configure policies for Recall

Organizations that aren't ready to use AI for historical analysis can disable it until they're ready with the **Turn off saving snapshots for Windows** policy. If snapshots were previously saved on a device, they'll be deleted when this policy is enabled. Administrators can't enable saving snapshots on behalf of their users. The choice to enable saving snapshots requires individual user opt-in consent.

The following policy allows you to disable analysis of user content:

| &nbsp; | Setting  |
|---|---|
| **CSP** | ./User/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/WindowsAI/[DisableAIDataAnalysis](mdm/policy-csp-windowsai.md#disableaidataanalysis) |
| **Group policy** | User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows AI > **Turn off saving snapshots for Windows** |



## User controlled settings for Recall

The following options are user controlled in Recall from the **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Recall & Snapshots** page:

- Allow snapshots to be saved 
- Website filtering
- App filtering
- Storage allocation
    - When the storage limit is reached, the oldest snapshots are deleted first.
- Deleting snapshots
    - Delete all snapshots
    - Delete snapshots within a specific time frame

### Applications that are automatically excluded from snapshots

snapshots won't be saved when certain applications are being used. The following apps are automatically excluded from snapshots:<!--9119193-->

- [mstsc.exe](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mstsc)
- [VMConnect.exe](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/learn-more/hyper-v-virtual-machine-connect) 
   - Microsoft Remote Desktop from the Microsoft Store is saved in snapshots. To prevent the app from being saved in snapshots, add it to the app filtering list.
- [Azure Virtual Desktop (MSI)](/azure/virtual-desktop/users/connect-windows) 
   - Azure Virtual Desktop apps from the Microsoft Store are saved in snapshots. To prevent these apps from being saved in snapshots, add then to the app filtering list.
- [remote applications integrated locally (RAIL)](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rdperp/485e6f6d-2401-4a9c-9330-46454f0c5aba) windows


### Storage allocation

The amount of disk space users can allocate to Recall varies depending on how much storage the device has. The following chart shows the storage space options for Recall:

| Device storage capacity | Storage allocation options for Recall |
|---|---|
| 256 GB | 25 GB (default), 10 GB |
| 512 GB | 75 GB (default), 50 GB, 25 GB |
| 1 TB, or more | 150 GB (default), 100 GB, 75 GB, 50 GB, 25 GB |



## Information for developers

If you're a developer and want to launch Recall, you can call the `ms-recall` protocol URI. When you call this URI, Recall opens and takes a snapshot of the screen, which is the default behavior for when Recall is launched. For more information about using Recall in your Windows app, see [Recall overview](/windows/ai/apis/recall) in the Windows AI API documentation.

## Microsoft's commitment to responsible AI

Microsoft has been on a responsible AI journey since 2017, when we defined our principles and approach to ensuring this technology is used in a way that is driven by ethical principles that put people first. For more about our responsible AI journey, the ethical principles that guide us, and the tooling and capabilities we've created to assure that we develop AI technology responsibly, see [Responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai).

Recall uses optical character recognition (OCR), local to the PC, to analyze snapshots and facilitate search. For more information about OCR, see [Transparency note and use cases for OCR](/legal/cognitive-services/computer-vision/ocr-transparency-note).
