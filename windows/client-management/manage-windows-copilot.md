# Manage Windows Copilot

Windows is the first PC platform to provide centralized AI assistance for customers. Together, with Bing Chat and first and third-party plugins, Windows Copilot helps you bring your ideas to life, complete complex projects and collaborate instead of spending energy finding, launching and working across multiple applications.

This article lists settings available to manage Windows Copilot. To learn more about Windows Copilot, see [Welcome to Copilot in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/welcome-to-copilot-in-windows-675708af-8c16-4675-afeb-85a5a476ccb0).

## Turn off Windows Copilot

This policy setting allows you to turn off Windows Copilot. If you enable this policy setting, users can't use Copilot. The Copilot icon doesn't appear on the taskbar either. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, users can use Copilot when it's available to them.
