# Configure kiosks and restricted user experiences

Organizations are constantly seeking ways to streamline operations, improve customer service, and enhance productivity. One effective solution is the deployment of kiosk devices. These specialized devices offer a range of benefits that can significantly impact an organization's efficiency and success. For example:

- Cost-effective customer service: kiosks allow organizations to provide essential services without the need for dedicated staff. Whether it's checking in at a hotel, ordering food at a restaurant, or printing boarding passes at an airport, kiosks reduce labor costs while maintaining service quality. Customers appreciate the convenience of self-service options, leading to higher satisfaction levels
- Reduced wait times: long queues and wait times frustrate customers and staff members. Kiosks expedite processes by allowing users to complete tasks independently. Whether it's paying bills, renewing memberships, or accessing information, kiosks empower users to get things done swiftly
- Consistent brand experience: kKiosks ensure a uniform brand experience across different locations. Whether in retail stores, schools, airports, or healthcare facilities, the interface remains consistent. Brand consistency builds trust and reinforces the organization's image
- Customization and flexibility: kiosks can be tailored to specific needs. From touchscreens to barcode scanners, organizations choose features that align with their goals. Whether it's self-checkout, wayfinding, or interactive product catalogs, kiosks adapt to diverse requirements

Windows offers two different experiences for public or specialized use:

:::row:::
    :::column span="1":::
    :::image type="content" source="images/kiosk.png" alt-text="Icon representing a kiosk." border="false":::
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="3":::
    #### Kiosk experience
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

This experience runs a single application in full screen, and people using the device can only use that app. When the designated kiosk account signs in, the kiosk app launches automatically. If the kiosk app is closed, it will automatically restart. This experience is sometimes referred to as *single-app kiosk*.

Windows offers two different features to configure a kiosk experience:

- **Assigned Access**: used to execute a single Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app or Microsoft Edge in full screen above the lock screen. When the kiosk account signs in, the kiosk app launches automatically. If the UWP app is closed, it will automatically restart
- **Shell Launcher**: used to configure a device to execure a Windows desktop application as the user interface. The application that you specify replaces the default Windows shell (`Explorer.exe`) that usually runs when a user signs in. This type of single-app kiosk doesn't run above the lock screen.

:::row:::
    :::column span="1":::
    :::image type="content" source="images/restricted-user-experience.png" alt-text="Icon representing a restricted user experience." border="false":::
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="3":::
    #### Restricted user experience
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

This experience loads the Windows desktop, but it only allows to run a defined set of applications. When the designated user signs in, the user can only run the apps that are allowed. This experience is sometimes referred to as *multi-app kiosk*. The Start menu is customized to show only the apps that are allowed to execute. With this approach, you can configure a locked-down experience for different account types.

To configure a restricted user experience you use the **Assgined Access** feature.

## Choose the right experience

When planning to deploy a kiosk or a restricted user experience, consider the following:

- Evaluate all applications that users should use. If applications require user authentication, don't use a local or generic
user account. Rather, target the group of users within the Assigned Access configuration file
- A multi-app kiosk is appropriate for devices that are shared by multiple people. When you configure a multi-app kiosk, certain policy settings that affects all non-administrator users on the device. For a list of these policies, see [Assigned Access policy settings](policy-settings.md)


There are several kiosk configuration methods that you can choose from, depending on your answers to the following questions.

A good approach is to ask yourself the following set of questions:

| | Question |
|--|--|
| **ðŸ”²** | *Which type of app will your kiosk run?* <br>Your kiosk can run a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app or a Windows desktop application.|
| **ðŸ”²** | *Which type of kiosk do you need?* <br>If you want your kiosk to run a single app for anyone to see or use, consider a single-app kiosk that runs either a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app or a Windows desktop application. For a kiosk that people can sign in to with their accounts or that runs more than one app, choose a restricted user experience.|
| **ðŸ”²** | *Which edition of Windows client will the kiosk run?"* <br>All of the configuration methods work for Windows client Enterprise and Education; some of the methods work for Windows Pro.|
| **ðŸ”²** | *Which type of user account will be the kiosk account?*<br>The kiosk account can be a local standard user account, a local administrator account, a domain account, or a Microsoft Entra account, depending on the method that you use to configure the kiosk. If you want people to sign in and authenticate on the device, you should use a multi-app kiosk configuration. The single-app kiosk configuration doesn't require people to sign in to the device, although they can sign in to the kiosk app if you select an app that has a sign-in method. |

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Single-app kiosk mode isn't supported over a remote desktop connection. Your kiosk users must sign in on the physical device that is set up as a kiosk.
