### Simplify Quick Settings Layout

If you enable this policy, Quick Settings will be reduced to only having the WiFi, Bluetooth, Accessibility, and VPN buttons; the brightness and volume sliders; and battery indicator and link to the Settings app. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the regular Quick Settings layout will appear whenever Quick Settings is invoked.

|  | Path |
|--|--|
| **CSP** | ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/[Setting]() |
| **GPO** | ** UM Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Start Menu and Taskbar** |
