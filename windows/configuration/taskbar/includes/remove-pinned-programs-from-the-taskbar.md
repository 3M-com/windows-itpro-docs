### Remove pinned programs from the Taskbar

This policy setting allows you to remove pinned programs from the taskbar. If you enable this policy setting, pinned programs are prevented from being shown on the Taskbar. Users can't pin programs to the Taskbar. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, users can pin programs so that the program shortcuts stay on the Taskbar.
