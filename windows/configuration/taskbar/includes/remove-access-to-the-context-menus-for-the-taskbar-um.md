### Remove access to the context menus for the taskbar

This policy setting allows you to remove access to the context menus for the taskbar. If you enable this policy setting, the menus that appear when you right-click the taskbar and items on the taskbar are hidden, such as the Start button, the clock, and the taskbar buttons. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the context menus for the taskbar are available. This policy setting does not prevent users from using other methods to issue the commands that appear on these menus.
