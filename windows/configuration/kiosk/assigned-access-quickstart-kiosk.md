# Quickstart: Configure a kiosk experience with Assigned Access

## Prerequisites

>[!div class="checklist"]
>Here's a list of requirements to complete this quickstart:
>
>- A Windows 11 device
>- Microsoft Intune, or a non-Microsoft MDM solution, if you want to configure the settings using MDM
>- Windows Configuration Designer, if you want to configure the settings using a provisioning package
>- Access to the [psexec tool](/sysinternals/downloads/psexec), if you want to test the configuration using Windows PowerShell

## Configure a restricted user experience

When using Settings:

AppId: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe
Arguments: --no-first-run --kiosk https://maps.cltairport.com/ --kiosk-idle-timeout-minutes=5 --edge-kiosk-type=public-browsing

> [!TIP]
> Use the following Graph call to automatically create a custom policy in your Microsoft Intune tenant without assignments nor scope tags.
>
> When using this call, authenticate to your tenant in the Graph Explorer window. If it's the first time using Graph Explorer, you may need to authorize the application to access your tenant or to modify the existing permissions. This graph call requires *DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All* permissions.

Alternatively, you can configure devices using a [custom policy][MEM-1] with the [AssignedAccess CSP][WIN-3].

## User experience

After the settings are applied, reboot the device. A user account named `Airport Kiosk` is automatically signed in, opening Microsoft Edge with an airport map.
