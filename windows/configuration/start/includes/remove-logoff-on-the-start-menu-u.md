### Remove Logoff on the Start menu

With this policy setting you can remove the **Sign out** item from the Start menu and prevents users from restoring it:

- If you enable this policy setting, the **Sign out** item does not appear in the Start menu
- If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, users can use the **Sign out** item in the Start menu

> [!NOTE]
>
> This policy setting affects the Start menu only. It doesn't affect the **Sign out** item on the Windows Security dialog box that appears when you press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>DEL</kbd>, and it doesn't prevent users from using other methods to sign out.
