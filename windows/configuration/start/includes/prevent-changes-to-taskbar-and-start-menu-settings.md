### Prevent changes to Taskbar and Start Menu settings

With this policy setting you can prevent changes to Taskbar and Start menu settings:

- If you enable this policy setting, users can't open the Taskbar or Start properties dialog box. If a user right-clicks the Taskbar or Start and then selects Properties, a message appears explaining that a setting prevents the action
- If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the Taskbar and Start Menu items are available from Settings on the Start menu
