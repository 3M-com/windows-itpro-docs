### Show *Run as different user* command on Start

With this policy setting you can hide the *Run as different user* command on the Start application bar. If you enable this setting, users can access the "Run as different user" command from Start for applications which support this functionality. If you disable or don't configure this setting, users can't access the *Run as different user* command from Start for any applications.

> [!NOTE]
> This setting doesn't prevent users from using other methods, such as the <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> right-click menu on application's jumplists in the taskbar to issue the *Run as different user* command.
